<strong>REMEMBERING A FRIEND - S Yousuf Ali</strong> <br><br>
I had for very long observed that dancers and singers became one with the activity they were into, at that given moment; similarly saints became one with the infinite while in meditation. So when I started wading through the web of Art, I was confronted with a strange query from within. Where do I find an artist who becomes one with the artwork while painting?<br><br>My reward came very early, when on a fateful night, I decided to drop Yousuf at his house late in the evening and I was invited for a cup of tea and snacks.<br>
<br>

Yousuf mostly painted during the night and after a few moments of preparation he sat opposite the canvas which was already in process.  It was at that moment I saw him change as if he slipped into the lake of creativity, came out drenched and lifted the brush to melt into the canvas. As if he was in some sort of a trance. The movements of his hands, quick and precise, glided on the canvas. The mixing of colours, the application of the medium on the canvas, the emergence of beautiful faces of singers and the musical instruments, the segmentation, all superb.<br><br> 

Larger than life - the faces, hands, feet all larger than life but stunningly beautiful. May be the divine creative source he was connected to at that point, was so large in everything - size, beauty, which was reflecting in his work. Aided by the infinite source, Yousuf was pouring his own very being on the canvas. The artist and the painting had become one. What a sight to behold. <br><br>


At least on two other occasions, I was blessed to see him painting. The horses taking shape, the dancers being painted, what strokes - what colours - what costumes? The flowers and what not? His ability to connect with the source of all Art made it possible for him to paint anything and everything. He could even translate his love for the Master in his eternal Allah series paintings.<br><br>

What is unique about this extraordinary artist friend of mine was that in spite of his brilliance and mastery, he remained unaffected by the dust, din and glitter of the world and chose to enjoy an ordinary lifestyle - the domain of saints, scholars and philosophers.<br><br>

I remember having penned a few lines about him while writing the Chairman's Note for The AURA ART Show 2008 catalogue, from which I quote:<br>
"Going back to that eventful year of 1983, I received a divine gift in the form of my friendship with S Yousuf Ali, an extremely brilliant artist, yet shy, simple and most unassuming. He created art only for art's sake - his paintings having a soul and a rare kind of beauty. We lost him early at the age of 'fifty seven' (in 1997), when he was at his peak. He was very passionate about art itself and I gained my initial knowledge about art from him. Today, his absence is a big vacuum I cannot reconcile with. I am sure, if he were there now, he would have been in the forefront of the reputed artists of the country as well as of Aura Art."<br><br>

We were drawn towards each other and became best friends because I liked everything about him - his mastery over the art he produced - his humane qualities. He perhaps was drawn to me inter-alia for my commitment to Art, heart foundations and other social works and was very happy to see poor young kids regaining hope and spark of life after treatment. So much so that he would sometimes gift paintings to Doctors who were performing surgeries on our heart patients, which the Doctors would tell me later on.<br><br>

Once we were in fort area and we walked into Pundole Art Gallery where we were pleased to find another great artist Husain sitting with his paintings hung for sale. I was filled with great pride when Husain told him - Yousuf, I have seen your works - they are wonderful.  I am very tempted to tell you to take my two paintings in exchange of one of yours.<br><br>

Such was his class. But it never went to his head - he was obsessed with ordinariness in all aspects of life, except Art where he was a legend in his lifetime. He shunned publicity and there was complete absence of commercial attitude in him. Even during his very successful exhibitions in The TAJ he avoided being photographed by press representatives and maintained a very low key. This was his way of keeping his soul intact. Even then, his works found their way in some of the best collections in the country and even outside India.<br><br>

Rather he felt pity for those who while amassing wealth sold their soul and lost the most precious gift of life. He had his ups and downs in life but never lost his childlike laughter and his dedication to his family and friends. He would keep his difficulties to himself. May be it was like a smoldering ember, burning quietly, slowly gathering its energy before revealing the full extent of its destructive potential. He fell ill and passed away retaining his touch of ordinariness even at that stage.  So used to offering help and gifts to others - may be his soul refused to accept help at the juncture.<br><br>


For me it was more than a friendship as I learnt much about Art from him. The pain was immense at his untimely demise - especially leaving the world unsung.  But his sincerity has kept the flame of friendship burning with me and with his other close friends like Shri Satish Pillai. The due recognition to his artistic talent is inevitable.  We also want to do our bit.  We have kept the torch burning.  <br><br>

The time has now arrived where the world should be exposed to the pinnacle of Indian Art - an artist who painted the Indian ethos like no one else has done yet.  I invite the entire art community to join hands in this effort as each shining star located and affixed on our art horizon adds to the overall brilliance of our artistic domain.<br><br>
