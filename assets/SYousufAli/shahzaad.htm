<strong>CONSISTENCY AND HONESTY STOLE MY HEART
</strong> 

<br><br>


I vividly remember the first time that I saw a painting by Shaikh Yousuf Ali, in the Aura Art Show in January 2008 - I was transfixed by this unpretentious artist, whose work seemed to tug onto ones heart with its sheer balance and proportion.  I had never seen a better symmetry of the human form, the palpable vigour of the lines, the marvellous blending of the colours and the tightness of the composition.  The continued look of pride on the face of Rishiraj as I stood in awe of this masterpiece only reiterated that I was admiring the crowning jewel of their collection.
<br>
<br>

I was fortunate to see more works of the artist subsequently in the Aura Art Gallery.  While it only reiterated my earlier observation, I was wonderstruck with the absolute honesty that the artist brought into his works - surely a reflection of the way in which he must have led his life.  While I am not a big connoisseur of art, nonetheless I do not lose an opportunity to absorb the artistic wealth of any region that I am travelling to.   But never before have I seen an artist whose entire body of work has attracted me, with equal interest.  The consistency displayed by Yousuf is something that many artists of the country should emulate - to do justice to each work as if it is your last gift to humanity... to be your permanent mark in the firmament of Indian Art...
<br>
<br>

Just when I thought I had seen everything there is to this consistent genius in his canvases, I was amazed to see the wealth of art in his water colour works, particularly the "Allah Series".  Despite the time I have spent in the Middle East, I have yet to come across a more accomplished calligraphy series, with unmatched vibrancy of colours and striking depictions of the different names of Allah.  And then there is the ultimate of truths, of the oneness of God, in the print on canvas of the artist who was surely the Messiah of Indian Art.
