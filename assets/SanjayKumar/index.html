   <td colspan="3"><h1>The Communion </h1>
      <p align="justify">While looking at a painting one is already into the domain of the Infinite. 
        Again, looking at works created by an Artist who is attempting to wade 
        through the Infinite by trying to fix an image which is part of the Infinite, 
        is all the more interesting. <br>

        Stage is now set for an activity which has sound fundamentals. <br>
        <br>

		Buddha is perhaps one of the few sages for whom we have mention of his 
        rather impressive physical characteristics - handsome, good-looking, and 
        pleasing to the eye, with a most beautiful complexion. He has a Godlike 
        form and countenance. According to tradition, Buddha emphasized ethics 
        and correct understanding. He questioned the average person's notions 
        of divinity and salvation. He stated that there is no intermediary between 
        mankind and the divine; and the Buddha is solely a guide and teacher for 
        the sentient beings who must tread the path of Nirvāna themselves to attain 
        the spiritual awakening called Bodhi and see truth and reality as it is. 
        The Buddhist system of insight and meditation practice is to be revealed 
        by the understanding of the true nature of the mind, which must be discovered 
        by personally treading a spiritual path guided by the Buddha's teachings. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Sanjay Kumar set 
        out to paint Buddha, a part of the Infinite. To tread on this path successfully 
        required readiness to be pulverized by the effort, inspiration and ideology. 
        Sanjay Kumar as a human being as well as an artist steadily progressed 
        and attained a level where he could feel the aura of Buddha while painting. 
        His poetic ability and clarity also grew. Quoted below is an English translation 
        of two lines out of his poem in Hindi. <br>
        <br>
        “Buddha is worshipped as God by the world. I don’t know if “Buddha” is 
        God or not, but I do believe that as intense the creative effort we put 
        in creating, as closer to God we reach. It is this attraction which fuels 
        my creative strength”. This led to the emergence of a very distinguished 
        personality and his paintings (on canvas as well as on paper) became not 
        only excellent works of Art, but also a pursuit of “Buddha”. Thus Sanjay 
        Kumar incessantly goes on to create Art works that have perfection, connectivity 
        and exhibit communion between a disciple and the Master. </p>
		
		<h1 align="justify">Thoughts of Sanjay Kumar</h1>  <p align="justify">“Just as it is difficult to pen down or express our feelings and emotions or understand the intricacies of love, beauty and aesthetics, it is very difficult to depict the personality of man. ‘Vyakti’ or Man – is much like a drop, a drop that can be seen or understood; a drop that can be measured or weighed... or even proved!  
But the ‘Vyaktitva’ or Personality of this very Man is deeper than the Ocean – much more difficult to understand, see or realize …  	Of course, the very existence of this deep ocean (Vyaktitva) can be realized or discovered through knowledge and wisdom within the drop (Vyakti) itself; made possible through yoga, meditation and penance only.  <br><br>
		
		And, after all, who has surpassed Buddha-the ultimate Yogi, engaged in meditation, immense penance and self-mortification? “The One” - who is above all religion or caste, joy or sorrow - light or dark?   
For he is the one - who is the central point and exists without boundaries; which is timeless and very much in the present here.  His meditative body language, natural facial expression offers inner tranquility and peace. And, after all what is more valuable to man, than peace of mind? Is not the present our best opportunity?   Does stability not give us ultimate happiness? It’s the answer to these queries that bring us closer to Buddha.  <br><br>Buddha is worshipped as God by the world. I don’t know if “Buddha” is God or not, but I do believe that as intense the creative effort we put in creating, as closer to God we reach. It is this attraction which fuels my creative strength.” </p></td>
