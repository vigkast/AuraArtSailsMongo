  <h1>Temple of the Future by Geetu Hinduja<br>
for Inside Outside, 
Feb 2008</h1> 
 <p>
 Ganesh Gohain is a sculptor. He was born and brought up in Assam and came to Vadodara as a young man to pursue a higher education in the fine arts. His memories of Assam form the basis and foundation of his work while Vadodara in a lot of ways has molded him and seen him evolve. His experiences in France and UK initiated the process where he began to envision a body of work that had a larger perspective. He did not see his exhibitions as singular efforts but smaller efforts towards creating an entire body of work scanning the years to come. <br>
<br>


According to Gohain “‘Temple of the Future’ is a body of work that represents a visionary study of the past, the present and the future of History. It is a study of existence to realize the illusion, the reality and the abstract which is a process to search for the truth.” 
<br>
<br>

His last exhibition which took place in Mumbai in April 2007 was also titled Temple of the Future. <br>
<em>“I have been working on this series since 2005 and all the works are questions …. to realize the future.”</em>
<br>
<br>

Peter Bevan a fellow sculptor, friend and guide to Gohain says: 
<br>
<em>"But he is not a philosopher; his approach is as an artist. In his work and ... through the way he works, he acknowledges such issues, and presents to us moments of awareness and personal insight, in which we can share. His works stimulate the viewer to become aware of their own sense of being, sense of identity and of their relationships with others. Gohain refers especially to family relationships and those with other persons from whom he has learnt about life and about art.”</em>
