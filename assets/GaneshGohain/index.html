  <h1>Temple of the Future by Ganesh Gohain, 2008</h1> 
 <p>
 
  
  
  What is the Sculptural Language that I always search and what it should be for me? Meaning of the volume, mass, form… Meaning of the inner and outer space etc…
  <br>
  <br>
  
  What the drawing should be and its meaning as a Sculptor and how I look at it etc. through my visionary perspective?
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <em>“ ‘Temple of the Future’ is a body of work that represents a visionary study of the past, the present and the future of History. It is a study of existence to realize the illusion, the reality and the abstract which is a process to search for the truth.” <br>
  <br>
    
    
    “I have been working on this series since 2005 and all the works are questions... to realize the future.”</em><br>
  <br>
  
  
  <strong>Searching from the darkness to light or towards the light.<br>
  <br>
    
    
    The Expression is very much poetic even the title...</strong><br>
  <br>
  
  
  In my Drawing, I always try to find wider space to contemplate my past experiences through lines, rubbing or depicting or merging etc, the space which is always within me. Putting paper layer after layer is to merge old image to realize the new or welcome the new one. All are for me the process to realize my existence in this world. I believe in past, present and future, the History, the frame which I always carry with me when the visionary thought comes in my mind or evolve something to come out in outer surface whether it is two dimensional or three dimensional. “A tree of Illusion”, “The Road which I passed through”, “Towards the Sky”, “The Abstraction or searching from the darkness” are the result of my visionary study of the history. For me it is important - where I belong and my origin in wider angle. I am always carrying the history of past, present and future and it helps me a lot to realize my existence.
  <br>
  <br>

  
  For the Sculptures, it should represent me, my body, soul, density, volume, weight, solidity, strength, existence, its contour, shape, line, construction to build up the form, space inner and outer etc. <br>
  1.“Torso from Vadodara-I”, represents the history of the future through a visionary study of the past history of Indus Valley Civilization, Greco-Roman Civilization in the contemporary context. <br>
  2.“Torso from Vadodara -II”, shows the inner space, the void of the body, the solidity, the strength, the contour, the shape, the weight etc. which have an important role.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Arcitectural, Structural, Monumental etc. all these are in my inner mind. Myths, culture, tradition etc remind me when I look back or look forward to my origin. For it is human tendency to realize their existence.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  “A Seed from Ellora” has lots of meaning to me, here the title is quite important. It is a visionary experience of Ellora, the form of Ellora, its solidity, its monumentality, its mysterious inner and outer space, its energy etc. I am carring a small seed from Ellora to be grown to be made, bigger and wider. So the title is very metaphysical to me. </p>
