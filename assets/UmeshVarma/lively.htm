<h1>Our Contemporary Artists <br>
Umesh Varma : <br>

A Painter with Lively Dimensions</h1>
<p>
    Umesh Varma's works are like reliving the most intimate moments of our lives. A gathering of card players here, a crowd at the Paanwallah's there. A husband and wife confronting each other, facing the reality of life, a group of women stretching themselves in a public park, on the only benches that could allow them a little sleep in a huddled position; and another scene of a house-interior where a house-wife lies fast asleep, dishevelled, waiting for her husband's return; a flute player playing his instrument with fascinated women watching him; also faces from his memory that seem to leave strong impression both on the mind of the painter as well as the viewer – these are the vignettes of life that Umesh Varma presents to his viewers. And they are so strong that they relive in one's memory with the same intensity with which the painter had painted them.

   Umesh Varma, while depicting life, could be both satirical, compassionate as well as critical. His emotional range, in fact, is considerable and when backed by his skilled hand and an extremely imaginative mind, the material handled by him could acquire the shape of a moving human document. Subtlity, dexterity, clarity of perception and the art of presentation are never lacking in Umesh Varma's works. And that is the reason why their appeal is lasting.
<br>
<br>

    As for his subject matter he picks up ordinary characters from life; scenes from the everyday world, intense and uncommon moments from people's lives and so on. There is never any lack of variety or a worthless choice. Often, it is what has moved the painter to a point where he is compelled to express his reaction, his assessment and his perception of the phenomenon. Humour and satire are of course common notes in his works. But pathos, compassion, love for the lyrical are not missing from his paintings.

    Umesh Varma, who had a good academic career and training in ceramics in Japan, has been pursuing his pet objective in the capital for long. He has mastered his technique and acquired a clear diction. That is why his works do not display any ambiguity of fuzziness as many a modern abstract  painters indulge in. His message is always straight and clear and does not need interpretation. But this does not mean that understanding his works does not require any aesthetic experience. In fact his works have several dimensions and are imbued with depth that needs fathoming. Varma's colours are rich and transfer that energy on to the viewer in ample measure. His lineal arrangements are subtle and dynamic. And his treatment of the available space is worth noting. Indeed it is difficult to find fault with his handling of the subject so far as the formal qualities of his works are concerned.
<br>
<br>

    Another cardinal quality of Umesh Varma's works is that they attempt to reach the poetic, attain artistic perfection. There's no casualness about his works. What he takes up, he takes up seriously. And what he takes up seriously, he makes his audience consider these seriously too. And in his endeavour to depict the vast panorama of life he takes you from one end of the spectrum to the other, On one hand you have 'The Blind Singer', which evokes pathos, and on the other you have 'Kaan Safa', a humorous rendering about the traditional ear cleaner.

    And it is an experience to view Umesh Varma's drawings. In this genre Umesh Varma touches the classical though saying so might sound an exaggeration. But in fact it is not. Although it is not my intention here to compare his paintings with his drawings , which would be unfair. In fact, what is intended here is to emphasize the expressive quality of his lines and his mastery over his themes.
    
   <br>
<br>


    It is rather sad that he is not handling ceramics, for which he was trained in Japan. But then, life probably pushes one in the direction he or she moves. Umesh Varma is not an imposing personality and would not like to be so, with his sensitive nature dictating him to be otherwise-to be more on the receiving end rather than take to aggressive self-advertising. Umesh is also blessed with a charming voice which he often uses for rendering folk songs of eastern Uttar Pradesh, beguiling his friends.
<br>
<br>
    Married, and brooding, Umesh Varma needs to be taken seriously, as an accomplished painter who has much to give to the art world in the years to come. Presently, he works at the Garhi Studios of the central Lalit Kala Akademi. There, one could see the rich store of his creativity though the buyers keep depriving him of his best.<br>
<br>

     His paintings are in the collection of important national and international galleries and with individual collectors. He has held numerous group shows and solo ones. Those have been significant events.
