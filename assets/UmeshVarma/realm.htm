All the members of the animal kingdom from the lowest on the evolutionary ladder to the most advanced of them all, the man, have the principles of management built in their system. This helps them to carry on their existence and live the time they are given to live, to the extent it is possible to do so on this living planet. Dependence on the plant kingdom as well as the system called our Earth is inevitable. Earth exists in the numinous cosmos and continues to weave time terrestrial and manage life on this living planet of ours with its natural numeric structure as a member of the family of Sun.</p>

Ours is the only living numinous planet we know of. Man ignorant wants know it all and own it allâ€¦Mahabharat continues. Man wants to know everything about him and also the entire system surround. Not all of them populating the earth are blessed with physical and intellectual faculties and the human sapience to wonder and become an enquiring question mark! Thanks infinite to those who are blessed with the right chemical composition of these qualities of the soul who asked questions, conducted experiments and 'found the black cat in the pitch dark black room where there was no cat at all'. </p>

<p>
Whatever was investigated, researched and found by the philosophical mind with vision and insight is common knowledge.</p>
<p><ol>

<li><p>	Every one knows that in our system Elephantine trunk movements are considered structural kinetic blessings of the numinous cosmos.</p>

<li><p>Five 'elements' essential for the 'emergence of life' are really not the elements of the periodic table's elements discovered by the scientists of empirical nature.
Five abodes of the constituents of life are 'the clay, the water, the air, the fire and the numeric space time.</p>
<li><p>The valentine bones existing in these fore mentioned 'five elemental abodes' incorporates the abode of the numeric space time which is beyond empirical research.</p>
<li><p>We belong to the numinous, yes very much so.</p>
<li><p>But, we must understand that we are not numen. We are not Gods. Management of life on the terra-ferma has its own responsibility.</p></ol>
<p>
I have learned to live with all this accumulated material that makes the conscious human being of the present time where materialism wants to overshadow the philosophic enquiry in the world of art to do away with the sense of wonder and simpler plastic solutions.

I am a logical extension of my tradition and culture. I am 'wonder struck', yes I am 'Acharaj'. I was born to Hindu Parents... It took me a lifetime to become a Hindu whatever that may mean.
