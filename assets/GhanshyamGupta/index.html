  <strong>Ghanshyam Gupta</strong> (born Dec 1, 1969) is a painter who has the rare honour of exhibiting his creations along with the some of the greatest artists of all times: Lucian Freud, Pablo Picasso, Paul Cezanne, Edward Munch, Henri Matisse, Rembrandt, and Albert Durer. He was part of the exhibition at London Original Print Fair held in 1997 at the Royal Academy of Art, London. He received the Nordsten Award for the Best Print of the year from the London Original Print Association and received the Art Museum Award Winner, from Tokyo International mini-print Triennial, Japan in 1998. Also to his credit is the most prestigious honour of receiving the Inlakes scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art, London. His works were included in Osians auctions. He is a sculptor, printmaker, and a painter.<br><br>
   His works are constantly in transformation. His latest series of painting are devoted to optical illusion on one hand and transcendental meanings on the other. Circles of colours revolve in centripetal and centrifugal permutations. </p>

 <h1>
   Artist's Note </h1>
   
   <p>
  I am a painter, sculptor and printmaker, and occasionally I write poetry. I like working on monumental sculpture. I have proficiency in stone carving, metal casting and fibre moulding works. I am able to use any media according to the demands of my work subject. I do printmaking, using various techniques. I have vastly used serigraph and etching.<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/GhanshyamGupta/images/p6.jpg" align="right">
  <br><br> The content and subject of my work are based on past experiences. I subconsciously filter these experiences and bring them out visually in an abstract figurative manner. The total image comes forth as intricate drawing which reflects my subconscious mind. <br>
The themes are based on love and fantasy although these are not literally depicted. Daily experiences from life influence my work. This is the essence of my work.      
  <br><br>
   While producing my work, I do not consciously set about making an image. I try to capture the essence of feeling or mood and depict it through various media. Some times I draw pictures of my inner world which in turns make me feel strange and mind boggling.
