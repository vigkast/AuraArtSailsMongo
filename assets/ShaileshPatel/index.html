<h1>Artist Shailesh Patel in conversation with Dr S K Kushwaha, Dean & Head of the Art History and Aesthetics Department, Faculty of Fine Arts, M S University of Baroda</h1><br>

      <div align="justify"><span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> 
        You are popular as an artist. What differentiates an artist from other 
        people?</span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> If I am a known painter today, it has 
        only been after years of struggIe. In my view, an artist is as much a 
        part of society as anyone else, but he differs from the common man in 
        terms of his sensitivity, the ability to visualise and the skills he is 
        endowed with. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong>. At what age 
        did you decide to pursue art? Was there any inspiration?</span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> After completing my schooling, I joined 
        the Faculty of Fine Arts, M S University of Baroda at the age of eighteen. 
        I did my B A Fine Arts in painting which I finished in 1986 -- thereafter 
        Post-Diploma in Mural and finally, M A in Creative Painting in 1993. <br>
        During my childhood days, I was always attracted towards the visual aspects 
        in and around, manifested in different shades of colours and the impact 
        it had on human life. That served as a great source of inspiration during 
        my study and training which was more of an institutionalised mode of art 
        education. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> I could see 
        the stress you made on the "insitutionalised mode of art education. " 
        Did you, at any point of time, think that the course was too tough for 
        you to continue?</span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> On the contrary. Whatever challenges 
        I had faced during my formal education in art, motivated me all the more 
        and proved to be more rewarding. I never thought of them as tasks and 
        that boosted my self-confidence. It also helped me rely on my tremendous 
        energy. I persisted and it paid off. Never did I think even once to escape 
        from those hardships during my years of study. I learnt a great deal in 
        terms of techniques, perception and evolved a highly personalized visual 
        vocabulary during my eight painstaking years of devotion as a student 
        of art. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> As a professor 
        of art, I am happy to hear that. But tell me, can you trace back any significant 
        links with art during your early schooldays?</span> <br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> During my schooldays, my drawing teacher 
        used to drag us in for art lessons. To tell you the truth, it was very 
        monotonous and I almost developed an apathy towards art education. It 
        troubled me to think that I should be in search of other sources to develop 
        my dormant talent in art. But once I got an appropriate avenue in terms 
        of college education, I was happy with myself and developed my own expression. 
        Therefore, I strongly feel the need to inspire art-minded children, guide 
        them in the right direction and develop their sensibilities. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> What was the 
        style and subject you first dealt with while creating artworks? Was there 
        an ideology behind your work?</span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> My form and contents in painting revolves 
        around different human conditions under various socio-cultural situations. 
        They are essentially narratives in visual framework, relying on the linear 
        quality of line with pigmentation underneath. I strongly believe in humanity 
        and try to convey through representative figures, man and his world around. 
        This is pivotal in my paintings, but it keeps on mutating. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> You said your 
        portrayal was of man and his world around. Is there any particular aspect 
        of his world you normally depict?</span> <br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> My imagery's stem usually from the mundane 
        life of man and his surroundings. I use different techniques in my work 
        based on the monumental and the diagonal layering of multiple perspectives 
        in close- knit interiors and demystification of women's faces with a subtle 
        eroticism. Of late, I am exploring mechanical human faces in my compositions. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> That's quite 
        creditable. With the passing of time, have there been any changes in your 
        creative approach?</span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> Yes, quite often my style undergoes rampant 
        transformation but never failing to maintain a sense of continuity though. 
        Therefore, there are stylistic variations which can be noticed from time 
        to time but they are nevertheless coherent to the scheme of my overall 
        work plan. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> Did you have 
        a mentor who inspired you?</span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> Initially I was inspired by Gulam Mohammed 
        Sheikh's work and he had helped me tremendously during my early days in 
        the faculty. Certainly I owe much to the great teachers who taught me 
        in the studio and many of them are living stalwarts in the contemporary 
        art scene. Whatever I have gained, I owe it to my mentors who used to 
        correct me every time I lost my sense of direction. Quite some time later 
        , I chanced to meet Mr Harmeet Singh Sethi, CEO of Aura Art, quite a unique 
        organisation in the art world.... set up to identify artists of calibre 
        and encourage them besides promoting well-known artists of the day. The 
        ideology of Aura Art, their qualitative inputs and the inspiration they 
        provided, contributed immensely in shaping my growth as an artist. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> That indeed 
        is a happy situation and your family must be happy too. Tell me, how much 
        support did you get from your family and from whom in particular ? </span> 
        <br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> I belong to a humble background, son 
        of parents who were both school teachers. They were my sole supporters 
        in my early days as a painter and when I decided to start my career as 
        a freelancer. I could have managed a job but my heart never allowed me 
        to pursue something like that. So, you see, I had to face tremendous hardships 
        during the early days of my career. My father was an epitome of sacrifice 
        in shaping my career as a professional painter. Without his moral, financial 
        and encouraging support I could not have reached this stage of success. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> How would you 
        rate yourself as an artist vis-à-vis other artists? How are you different?</span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> This is a very tricky question you are 
        asking to me! Every artist has his own rating; it all depends on the consistency 
        and sustainability in his time of boom along with other market forces. 
        One point is clear -- the pricing and saleability of an artwork cannot 
        be the sole criteria to assess anybody's ratings. But I feel confident, 
        the day is not far when I will be counted among the top artists of our 
        times -- and I do not hesitate in saying, I will be at par with M F Hussain 
        and Pablo Picasso's stature. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> You have shifted 
        to a new larger house at Vadodara. Has it influenced your work in any 
        way?</span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> Yes, I shifted to my new large house 
        some time back with the help of friends and well-wishers. It has provided 
        me with good working space to paint without interruption. The serene environment 
        has influenced my creative space as well, allowing me to concentrate and 
        contemplate. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> What does the 
        future hold for you? Do you believe you will make a mark on the art scene 
        of India?</span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel: </strong>I am very optimistic about my future 
        and can prove my worth as a talented artist. I am confident I will make 
        a mark not only on the post modern art scene of India but that of the 
        world too! <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> So that means 
        the value of your work is on the upswing. What is your latest "score”?</span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> Between four lacs to five lacs rupees 
        at the Osian auction of 2008. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> Having been 
        an aspiring, budding artist yourself at one time, have you attempted in 
        helping other budding artists? </span> <br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> Yes, I always make it a point to introduce 
        upcoming artists whom I consider worth interacting with, to buyers and 
        collectors of art. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> Do you believe 
        that God is the creator of all beauty including art, and that the artist 
        should first try to attain connectivity with the Master and then proceed 
        to paint? </span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> Yes, I strongly believe God has created 
        everything on this earth whether they are ugly or beautiful, animated 
        or non animated. But the creation of art is a process which has to be 
        monitored by human hands. That is why in oriental thought, imitation of 
        nature was never accepted because nature's creator is different and nature 
        cannot be imitated or interfered with. Whenever man has sought to disturb 
        nature's equilibrium in any manner, it has only resulted in chaos and 
        disaster. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Dr S K Kushwaha:</strong> Do you eventually 
        intend ploughing back a good part of your earnings for the upliftment 
        of art ? </span><br>
        <strong>Shailesh Patel:</strong> Yes, I certainly have some good social 
        causes in mind. My long cherished ambition to help the blind and the preservation 
        of nature that I owe a great deal to, are foremost in my mind. I know 
        it may be a marathon task -- but to fulfill this wish, my wife and I, 
        with her consent, decided not to raise children. The sacrifice she has 
        made to see me succeed in life is monumental and cannot be compensated 
        in material terms. Yes, I am very serious about the promotional aspects 
        of art with the cooperation of art lovers and connoisseurs. I am sure 
        I will be active in this area of activity too. <br>
