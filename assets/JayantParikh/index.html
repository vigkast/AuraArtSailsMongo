	<h1>Harmeet Singh Sethi, CEO, Aura Art  <br>in conversation with artist 
        Jayant Parikh</h1>
      <div align="justify"><span class="textborder"><strong>Harmeet Singh:</strong> 
        Can you describe the extent of your interaction with Prof N S Bendre as 
        a student at the Faculty of Fine Arts, M S University of Baroda?</span><br>
        <strong>Jayant Parikh:</strong> Prof N S Bendre was my Guru for 9 years. 
        Before Prof. N S Bendre left Baroda in 1967 after staying in the city 
        for 16 years, he called me at his residence and said and I quote,“Jayant, 
        I see hidden potential in you for the rhythmic forms, rich colours and 
        spacious compositions and the possibility of exploration of a meaningful 
        visual vocabulary. You must develop a sense of appreciation for the Indian 
        classical music and develop your canvas as raga progresses from simple 
        'alap' to a more complex form of 'druta'. He further stressed that and 
        I quote, “you should learn how to commune with nature and feel the vibrancy 
        of cosmological variation.”<br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Harmeet Singh:</strong> So how much is 
        the influence of Indian classical music and dance in your artworks?</span><br>
        <strong>Jayant Parikh:</strong> As a painter, the richness of colour, 
        the figurative forms I create and the divine rhythm in my compositions 
        are a result of the inspiration I have drawn from Indian classical musicians 
        and dancers like Sultan Khan, Kishori Amonker, Kumar Gandharva, Pandit 
        Bhimsen Joshi, Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, Birju Maharaj to name a few. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Harmeet Singh:</strong> What else inspires 
        you for your compositions?</span><br>
        <strong>Jayant Parikh: </strong>Besides music, Indian cultural heritage 
        is a great source of motivation to me. I regularly visit places which 
        provide me an opportunity to be at ease with nature. I also enjoy visiting 
        forts, palaces, temples, caves etc. as a source of inspiration for new 
        creative forms. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Harmeet Singh:</strong> I have observed 
        that there is a tremendous sense of multiplicity of forms in your work 
        based on a strong musical undertone, evolving a coherent representation 
        of movement. Would you throw some light on this?</span><br>
        <strong>Jayant Parikh:</strong> Whenever I look at such architectural 
        structures, I start assuming a sense of shuddering in my body and visualise 
        the theme for my composition, certainly based on the notion of movement 
        and the pulsating vibrancy in the form of rhythm which got frozen in these 
        spacious outdoors, constantly poignant in me. And finally, these forms 
        find their way into the panoramic vision of space and impacts the human 
        mind. <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Harmeet Singh:</strong> What is your 
        reaction to the element of acrobatics in your compositions?</span><br>
        <strong>Jayant Parikh:</strong> Since my childhood days I was charmed 
        with acrobatics. I learnt the Malkhambh - a traditional acrobatic form. 
        So at times there is an element of somersaulting cluster of human figures 
        floating around in my artworks, growing and diffusing in mystic space. 
        My human figures are human trajectory in a given space derived from the 
        historic past and configured in the context of the contemporary present. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="textborder"><strong>Harmeet Singh: </strong>Who was instrumental 
        in your development and growth as an artist?</span><br>
        <strong>Jayant Parikh:</strong> Apart from Prof. N S Bendre whose teachings 
        equipped me with a balance of skill and sensibilities and enhanced my 
        drawing abilities, my elder brother Natu Parikh helped me gain finer insights 
        in art. Later, my association with Aura Art with its principle ideology 
        of promoting art and artists, significantly influenced my work, not only 
        in terms of qualitative inputs and ojectivity but also in terms of my 
        growth as an artist. <br>
        <br>
        Here I would be failing in my duty if I do not mention the names of Mr 
        Kekoo Gandhi, Mrs Khorshad Gandhi and Mrs Uttara Parikh who provided support 
        to me in my formative years. </div></td>
