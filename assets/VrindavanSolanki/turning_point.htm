		<h1>The Turning Point</h1>
            <p align="justify"> From carefree meanderings in the Gir forest, from 
              the dusty pagdandis of Junagadh, a lad influenced by poetry tore 
              himself away from the goatherds and banjarans, and made his way 
              to Bombay, seeking there his gurukul of art. The city was a cocoon, 
              nurturing his chrysalis of talent. A talent for line and form that 
              was recognized at first flight. What won the young artist recognition 
              and awards, and eventually a place among the stalwarts, was his 
              ability to capture a luminescence out of the deftly spun hatchwork, 
              glowing through his crisscross of black lines on canvas, that reflected 
              the spiritual purity of his folk subjects.<br><br><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/VrindavanSolanki/images/p456.gif" align="left" />
              But Mumbai’s influence on Vrindavan, though subtle, went deep. Preconditioned 
              by a rural sensibility that was already shaping the future forms 
              in his work, he was unaware that there was an urban strand to the 
              double helix that was responding to this external environment. His 
              perception had elided off the cityscape and asphalt jungle, but 
              paused to marvel at the felt ambience of this sprinkling of magnificent 
              edifices nestling within Mumbai’s central core. The young Solanki, 
              trying to root himself in an alien environment, formed a lasting 
              attachment to these gothic structures, seeing in them an art-reality. 
              The buildings were objective, solid, seemingly eternal; in a city 
              of flux, they promised security and continuity to this beginner.<br>
              <br>
              Mumbai’s formative influence on Solanki was not to be acknowledged 
              for years – till its ultimate surfacing in this show. The paintings 
              here are not a passing nod, nor a dutiful salute, and not a prayerful 
              obeisance – what one sees in them is a complete out pouring of affectionate 
              respect. And gratifyingly, one sees the willingness of a mature 
              artist to dare to break new ground, to re-invent himself. This effort 
              resounds with the joy of release that young Vrindavan must have 
              felt when effecting his first transition decades ago.<br>
              <br>
              This turning point is marked in time and place - with the start 
              of a new millennium that forces one to turn one’s back on one’s 
              past work to face the challenge of the future. And the place itself, 
              transformed in name from Bombay to Mumbai, re-invigorated by fresh 
              winds of global change, re-defining itself. Solanki too marks out 
              totally uncharted co-ordinates in his artistic geography. And from 
              this new standpoint, he takes sightings of the oft-visited old places 
              and street faces, and plunges ahead into new territory. What we 
              see are unexpected and bold strides in direction: tints and tones 
              enriching what used to be pen and line, shadows in shapes, subtle 
              hues and shades, unconventional techniques applied to conventional 
              facades.<br>
              <br>
Solanki has arrived at a decisive new platform – in figure, form 
              and colour. As infrared to ultraviolet and colours in between combine 
              into what the eye sees as light, Solanki’s oeuvre is not one that 
              polarizes or refracts, but one that synthesizes the essence and 
              enlightens, not in a coldly scientific mode, but in a warm humanism 
              that shines through in every work.<br>
              <br>
              Solanki’s artistic journey has always been, in a certain sense, 
              a pilgrim’s progess. This turn in his artistic journey has fellow 
              travelers that he acknowledges in a novel way. He mixes in the shades 
              of dry pastels on much like the bhelwala concocts his recipe of 
              colour. Each visually entrancing prospect of a Mumbaikar encountered 
              – from dabbawala to patiwala – is set down in earthy tones, and 
              together they present a microcosm of Mumbai. Solanki bridges his 
              rural-urban divide with a simultaneous leap into hues and shades 
              hitherto taboo. No longer are they a distraction in his homage to 
              deified tradition, but a means to his joyous liberating participation 
              in the reality of the urban spectrum.<br>
              <br>
              These commoner’s lives are interlinked in a daisy-chain of interdependence, 
              of Solanki's identifying them as the indefatigable bedrock spirit 
              of Mumbai is evident in each portrayal. The acrylics, pastels and 
              etchings taken together form a unified base, the edifices and people 
              resonating off each other. Much as the stone structures impose on 
              one’s consciousness, these faceless unidentified people are to Solanki, 
              as always, the sap on which the city lives and has its being.<br>
              <br>
              In the artist’s earlier works, his “faceless faces” were not a lack 
              of recognition, but due to a sense of reverence, an unwillingness 
              to limn the divine. But whether bangdis or odhni, every stroke of 
              the overall imagery communicated a compelling description of his 
              subject’s identify that no detail of nose or turn of ear could capture. 
              Solanki’s canvases shared glimpses of his eternal people sealed 
              in an age-old identity of subscribed tradition. Turning away his 
              point of focus would have been traumatic if it were sudden. Bound 
              as he was by the umbilical cord of joined identity, he would take 
              a couple of years after the initial thought was broached, to acknowledge 
              the undeniable influence of an art-nurturing city. There was much 
              introspection before the rural strand in the helical turn admitted 
              the existence within his artistic DNA of the urban genome. And yet 
              as each gene relates to a feature or trait that manifests in maturity, 
              so too in the fullness of time arrived these expressions. Now finally, 
              Solanki lets us see both figures and features, perhaps just hinted 
              at, but the very vagueness purposefully underlining the everyman 
              nature of his subject.<br>
              <br>
              Aficionados of Solanki’s work – and those who may have been so far 
              outside this sizeable coterie – will need to re-assess the artist 
              in this fresh revelation of his acknowledged talent. The stretched 
              new canvas is a portent of an exciting phase – not face-less or 
              hue-less any more. The genie, one might say, is out of the bottle. 
              An earlier obsessive rural bias has been provided soft release. 
              Given his undoubted skill, his eye for composition and form, the 
              deftness of hand evident in each stroke, we can hope that this crossover 
              will, going forward, build on the augmented creative strengths this 
              show has uncovered.</p><br>
