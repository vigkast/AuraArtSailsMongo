      <p align="justify"> A vista of rural men and women, faceless entities with 
        innate expressions drawn and painted in black and white, adorning elaborately 
        patterned costumes and intricately designed jewelry, busily engaged in 
        their daily routine or simple social milieu: these have continued to be 
        recurring themes in the vast repertoire of master artist Vrindavan Solanki. 
        This together-with evocative drawings and paintings of the mountainous 
        landscapes, suburban views of the Saurashtra region, and architectural 
        landmarks of the city of Mumbai. Such have been the artist’s playing fields 
        over the last four decades. They present an interesting collage of his 
        artistic sojourns marking some amazing innate creations. 
      <p align="justify"> <strong> Re-tracing the Roots</strong> <br>
        The roots of Vrindavan Solanki’s artistic oeuvre, ethnic in its resonance, 
        reach back to Junagadh in rural of Gujarat of pre-Independence India, 
        where he was born and where he spent his childhood growing up in a middle-class 
        joint family of coppersmiths. With meager resources and second youngest 
        amongst six siblings, Solanki showed little interest in family matters 
        or academic pursuits, preferring instead to spend his time idling around, 
        going for solitary long walks in the forest amidst nature, reading and 
        writing poetry, working in theatre, drawing and sketching, or helping 
        his over-worked mother with household chores. Quiet and shy by nature, 
        he preferred the silence of the woods or the solitude of his home, to 
        playing games like the rest of lads in his neighbourhood. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/VrindavanSolanki/images/p455.gif"  align="left"/>With no artistic lineage to boast of, Solanki’s life and the track of 
        his creative work have gone through many twists and turns. He had to struggle 
        hard to fend for himself, throughout his student years and the early stages 
        of his career. In his personal life, though, the “happy-go-lucky” fellow 
        who believes in fate, has been fortunate enough to find his soul-mate 
        and wife in Chitra. They left Junagadh over two decades ago in search 
        of better opportunities and relocated themselves in the city of Ahmedabad. 
        This has continued to be their base since then, and this is where they 
        live with their son Bhishma, now a young man. This peaceful and contented 
        personal graph gets mirrored in the artist’s creative outpouring that 
        is bereft of any suggestions of struggle or violence or politics. Instead, 
        it offers delight and solace through its earthy, simple appeal endowed 
        with beauty and sensuality. <br>
        <br>
        Following the advice of one of his teachers, Solanki first joined the 
        J.J. School of Art in Mumbai. Though he did well in his exams he found 
        the course too academic for his practical turn of mind, and the city of 
        Mumbai too impersonal and expensive to live in. His lack of English and 
        reserved nature made him feel a misfit in the metropolis. So he left for 
        Baroda to pursue his studies at the M.S. University there. Given his talent, 
        he was admitted to the painting course straightaway. But the success of 
        his first show in Mumbai, while he was still in the last year of his diploma 
        course in painting at Baroda, lured him away from his studies. He began 
        to focus his energies on creating drawings and paintings that he sold 
        to discerning collectors, returning to the college only ten years later, 
        not only to complete his studies for a diploma in painting, but also to 
        take up a post-diploma course in graphics. <br>
        <br>
        Having tasted success at an early stage, when he sold his first two paintings 
        for six hundred rupees on the opening day of his first-ever solo show 
        at the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai in 1969 to a discerning collector, 
        Solanki has not had to look back since then. Successive exhibitions, commissions 
        and a five-year stint of teaching art at the National Institute of Design 
        in Ahmedabad gave him the much-needed financial security, besides enhancing 
        his self – confidence. Socially committed, Solanki’s track record also 
        includes several artistic initiatives and cultural festivals that he organized, 
        such as an Artist’s Workshop focusing on the city’s heritage for the Ahmedabad 
        Municipality, and a group exhibition with young artists for an Inside 
        – Outside mega show. The accomplished artist’s work has featured in a 
        text book, which is taught as a part of the 10th class curriculum for 
        Gujarat state Education Board students. <br>
        <br>
       <strong> Innate Expressions</strong> <br>Solanki’s imagery, serene and rustic on the one hand, 
        reverberates with innate expressions on the other, evoking a feeling of 
        eternity and timelessness. There are paintings featuring single figures, 
        or couples or group of people. While their heads are often covered partially 
        or fully with a pallu, chunri, chaddar or pagadhi, his figuration is characterized 
        by omission of details on the face. Resorted to for dramatic effect, it 
        communicates despite the absence of facial features. A closer, prolonged 
        look reveals a myriad hues and patterns on the bedecked finery of men 
        and women of the shepherd tribe engaged in chatting, or busy sharing their 
        joys and sorrows, or recalling legends. <br>
        <br>
        The imagery of village folk and scenes of his native Junagadh and surrounding 
        towns seem to flow naturally from Solanki’s brush. Attired in block-printed 
        sarees, and ghagras and amazingly crafted jewellery, the women appear 
        graceful and sensuous, not erotic, and the men in their stately dhotis, 
        and pagadhis, self-composed. A filial, benevolent atmosphere pervades 
        works where mother and child make a appearance in delicate renderings. 
        His nomadic characters appear aloof but self-assured, even as they struggle 
        to eke out in living on the periphery of today’s urban sprawl. <br>
        <br>
        There are other compositions where the figures, standing, sitting, or 
        squatting, singly or huddled in groups, at times with their backs to the 
        viewer, are seen gazing into the distance, adding a palpable dimension 
        of suspense to his otherwise static, anonymous portraiture. The swirling 
        ghaghras, hugging cholis, embroidered jackets, tie-and-die odhnis and 
        voluptuous head-gear provide rich imagery, while their twinkling anklets, 
        colourful bangles and tattooed arms tell their own stories. <br>
        <br>
        His mother-and-child series are delicate portrayals of maternal love whether 
        in repose, or engaged in household chores. Two large, striking oil paintings, 
        in this genre, dominate the current show. Solanki’s creative versatility 
        extends to evocative drawings of landscapes and cityscapes including landmark 
        buildings and city scenes of Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Baroda etc with details 
        of arches, balconies, carved canopies, the like of many of which have 
        since been reduced to dust. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Method & Matrix</strong> <br>
        Solanki works in a wide range of media: oil and acrylic on canvas, drawings 
        on paper, and graphics: etchings. Lithographs and screen prints. A conscientious 
        and meticulous artist, he starts regularly at six in the morning and goes 
        on until late in the evening each day of the week. Working as he does 
        on more than one painting at any given time, his is slow process which 
        takes him weeks to complete one small work. Solanki talks to his canvas 
        as one would to a companion, even as he claims that he is not a very social 
        or outgoing type. This however seems somewhat misplaced if one considers 
        the number of workshops and interactive sessions he has organized for 
        young artists and art students to make them aware of their environment 
        and roots. <br>
        <br><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/VrindavanSolanki/images/p309.gif" align="right">
        Preferring to work in series, his repository includes drawings and paintings 
        of simple folk of the region as well and landscapes Saurashtra, the rocks 
        and forest of Girnar, and Bombay cityscapes. “People fascinate me”, says 
        the artist. On his obsession with drawing faces without features he explains, 
        “People are two faced – inner and outer” and rather than show their one 
        face and not the other he draws faceless people or featureless faces “I 
        see no need of these on the face”. For him their body language says its 
        all. Each painting captures a different persona encased within his/her 
        frame of mind. There are images of Rabari women, milk maids, Girnar hills, 
        surrounding forests and familiar cityscapes with their architectural features. 
        ‘Romancing the line’ the title of another one of his earlier solo shows 
        highlights his focus on line work in drawings as well as paintings. <br>
        <br>
        Meticulous planning and hard work go into each work. The artist first 
        makes a sketch; then visualizes it on a larger scale. As the white canvas 
        stares at him, he wonders, “What should be around the figure? Should I 
        create a black patch or leave it just like that, as a pure white halo?” 
        Leaving some portions of the canvas blank in white “becomes an active 
        part in my work as it allows the light to flow in”, and here the artist 
        refers not just the day light "but also an inner spiritual light". His 
        fine lines and realistic renderings add a magic, a sensuality and earthiness 
        to the energy and appeal of his figuration. <br>
        <br>
        Solanki’s people can be seen engaged in social inter-action, be they men, 
        women or children. It is the delicacy and the linear quality of a woman’s 
        figure that the artist finds irresistible, while for men it is their strength 
        or physique that he likes to focus on. In portraying children he concentrates 
        on their innocence. In all cases his human form is marked by the delicacy 
        and dynamic movement in bold line work. Even when seated, his people, 
        their pallus or dhotis flowing with the wind, seem animated as they engage 
        in conversation. A serene mood is created through fine craftsmanship and 
        it is this mood that pervades the featureless faces of people in his works. 
        Solanki’s works are mostly black-and-white renderings, though sepia and 
        brown are occasionally added for detailing in some of the works. It is 
        the black rocks of the Saurashtra mountains and dark forest of the Girnar 
        region that seem to creep into his landscape imagery. ”That contrast has 
        lived in my mind and gets reflected in my figures and landscapes”. On 
        his limited use of colour the artist says, “I never felt left out for 
        wanting to add color………… all possible colours are absorbed in my shades 
        of black and white”, though he might go in for colour one day if the need 
        arises. The use of oil-bars that he has been experimenting with on recent 
        years was triggered off by a visit to New York where he bought them. The 
        first resulting work on canvas, which included browns and a limited use 
        of pastel shades, was a gift to his wife. <br>
        <br>
        For Solanki the practice of art is a spiritual experience, an act of devotion. 
        In his view,”drawing is crucial, and I make variations in my practice, 
        sometimes using a brush and at others charcoal”. Beginning with simple 
        sketches and line drawings , etched gradually in deft strokes and measured 
        smudging, his work graduates to larger images and complete expressions 
        in figurative paintings and drawings. Revelling in his roots and working 
        in hatched lines on canvas, a chiaroscuro effect is created to lend mood 
        and character to the imagery, where not just the portrait, but also the 
        fabric it adorns, holds it own in a balanced compositional grid. There 
        is an omission of more decorative elements and incorporation of abstraction 
        in his later and more matured work though the figure has continued to 
        be both his main obsession and nemesis. <br>
        <br>
        Though open to such innovation and change as his own work has undergone 
        over the years, as his compositions in oval form, for Solanki art must 
        belong to the soil. He does not believe in art that blindly imitates the 
        west or Lacks roots. Apart from sketches, drawings and paintings of figures, 
        landscapes and cityscapes, Solanki was commissioned to do the mural for 
        the Air-India office in New York. His detailed drawings and paintings 
        of Mumbai and Ahmedabad, landmarks of the 1980s and 90s, constitute important 
        historical documentation apart from beautiful imagery. A similar series 
        resulting from a study tour of Jamshedpur, at the invitation of the Tata 
        Group, was featured in their annual calendar for the year 1991. <br>
        <br>
        Line after line, layer over layer filling, overlapping and smudging, the 
        artist has been able to create striking chiaroscuro effects with his play 
        of light-and-shade in black and white. Noteworthy is the whiteness of 
        moon-beams reflected through trees in one of his monochromatic works rotating 
        around Girnar, and the changing seasons and moods they evoke. Diligently 
        worked lines and hatching create a realistic and dreamy aura around the 
        work. Solanki also uses rabbit-glue and gesso to prepare the surface of 
        his canvas for added technical flexibility. With a mix of charcoal, pen-and 
        ink, oil, acrylic and blow-torch technique on wood, Solanki’s featureless 
        faces begin to assume a distinctive character. Bamboo sticks traditionally 
        used by traders, and nibs that he got familiar with in America, are his 
        favorite tools. Watered down acrylic is used to make its consistency more 
        liquid. <br>
        <br>
        The prolific artist, whose enormous repertoire has been exhibited in nearly 
        two hundred shows throughout India and internationally, has several awards 
        to his credit and is a collector’s delight. Though, like his contemporaries, 
        the artist is happy for his work to be seen, admired and collected, when 
        the time comes to part with it, he says, “On the last day of my show, 
        as the works come down, I begin to feel an emptiness creeping inside me 
        and my eyes turn moist”. At such moments, the sketch book which is Vrindavan’s 
        constant companion brings him solace and recall. There are numerous drawings, 
        large and small, made over the years that add to his repertory, encompassing 
        people, landscapes, urban cityscapes, objects and events. Though so far 
        the artist has kept his figurative works and landscapes apart in two distinct 
        domains, it would be interesting to see in what stream his creativity 
        flows if he were to extend his subject matter into a wider art-scape, 
        or include people in his landscapes and some of the interiors or architectural 
        features in his figuration. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>To sum up</strong>: a distinctive feature of Vrindavan Solanki’s 
        artistic philosophy is its rustic appeal. His images, in whatever genre, 
        are bonded to his environment and emanate from his own experiences and 
        shared interests with people he has lived his life with. There is grace 
        and stateliness in his folk, be they Rabari men, women or children; or 
        Kolis and other tribals, in the way they stand, sit, squat or walk, talk 
        and conduct themselves. The beauty and grace of his women in their noble 
        appearance, richly embroidered garments and their jholas offer a contrast 
        to his men. A different sort of ambience is featured in his renderings 
        of picturesque mountains, dark forests and quiet nature-scapes. There 
        are intimate sketches of shepherds, their rural habitats, city-scapes, 
        events and objects. With a turn of the head, or the positioning of their 
        torsos, or grace in their walk, they exude a serenity encased in beauty 
        and sensuality. The work in the exhibition includes oil and acrylic paintings, 
        drawings and graphics of people and their meanderings in the comfort of 
        their familiar surroundings. Their tight fitting cholis, flowing ghagras, 
        patterned sarees, elegant veils or majestic turbans swirl, sway, conceal 
        and reveal their mood and character to make the current show a suite of 
        impressive innate expressions. <br>
