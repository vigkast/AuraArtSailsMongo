      <p> It is no accident, perhaps, that at a moment when Western society seems 
        to be bound in ever-tightening circles of enslavement to the priorities 
        of a denaturised, electronically-obsessed and intensely materialistic 
        culture, people are increasingly turning towards an art that proclaims 
        its rejection of such and the fundamentally mechanistic and disillusioned 
        creative work that emerges out of such debased values, one that proposes, 
        instead, a re-exploration of those core expressive values of poetry and 
        imagination, colour and nature, painting and drawing.</p>
      <p>The wonder is that, given the huge concerns that are now so forcefully 
        beginning to emerge about climate change and the destruction of the environment, 
        how comparatively disjointed and still comparatively few in number (and 
        how disparaged in official artistic circles also) these Western artists 
        are – in this country Alan Davie, Len McComb, Evelyn Williams, the young 
        Leeds-based painter Christopher P. Wood are among the few such names that 
        come readily to mind. All of which may help to explain, in part at least, 
        the quite remarkable flowering of interest that has been taking place 
        in the country in contemporary Indian art, not simply among Indian collectors 
        here, but among English writers and collectors also, with the recent opening 
        of several major galleries in London, Art Pilgrim London among them, showcasing 
        the now extraordinary range and depth of recent Indian art.</p>
      <p>Considered among the finest painters of the middle generation of Indian 
        artists, with a string of major shows behind him in both public and private 
        spaces on the sub-continent, Sidharth’s second London exhibition, of over 
        thirty works from his recent, much praised Baramaha series (2003-6) at 
        the gallery, is thus an event of very particular significance for our 
        understanding of this phenomenon. With their revelation of a quite profound 
        understanding for the symbolic and sensuous elements of colour, innate 
        sympathy for the natural world and quiet mastery of materials, these paintings, 
        of the Indian months of Phalgun, Poukh, Manghar and Waisakh, (some 12 
        in all) make it clear that Sidharth is an artist who will surely establish 
        himself with British audiences as well as Indian.</p>
      <p>Sidharth’s is a remarkable story, the patterns, and passion which were 
        established early in childhood when, as one of six children of an impoverished 
        Punjabi agricultural family, he sat and watched his mother grinding and 
        mixing the rock and earth colours that she would use to paint the papier-mache 
        bowls and toys which she would sell to make extra income for her family. 
        “Since my childhood I have been searching for my colours, my colours, 
        the colours of Nature, the colours that talk to me” he now observes and, 
        in the extreme happiness of a childhood where his mother would ask him 
        every evening not ‘What did you do today?’ but ‘What did you see today?’ 
        we can see, unmistakeably, the roots of the cute visual habits and energies 
        that have infused his work ever since.</p>
      <p>Brought up in the Sikh tradition, one of which he is enormously proud 
        even to this day (though no longer practising), his earliest work, (aged 
        12-13), other than decorating the walls of grand houses for a master mason, 
        was making devotional pictures for the sikh temple. By the age of 15, 
        realising he needed proper tuition, he left home to apprentice himself, 
        for some five years, in the techniques of Thangka painting practised by 
        the Tibetan Lamas at Dharamashala, their use of only natural colours reinforcing, 
        for a period at least, the lessons he had learnt from his mother while 
        their understanding of the act of painting as an act of painting ever 
        since. A brief and unhappy winter in Sweden with a fellow Swedish student 
        followed, (though even from this Sidharth learnt some significant artistic 
        lessons, the Rembrandt and St Birgitta’s Church there marking the beginnings 
        of an understanding for western art that has continued to grow over the 
        years) before he returned to India and resumed his studies at Chandigarh 
        College of Art for some five years.</p>
      <p>Over the next decade or so, working for the most part in oil on canvas, 
        Sidharth began his travels in the rural Punjab, discovering the folk motifs 
        that were to form the basis of his subject matter right up to the mid 
        1990s – notably the critically well-received Satappu (Hopscotch) and Mela 
        (Fair) series – before a growing dissatisfaction with the limitations 
        of such themes and techniques led to a dramatic reappraisal of his aims 
        and intentions and, in 1997, the quite astonishingly rich and beautiful 
        series of works on paper entitled Neti Neti of 1997 – 2003 (literally 
        ‘Not this, Not that’ , a term used in Hindu scriptures when explaining 
        God, the Infinite). They mark a fundamental break with the work that had 
        immediately preceded it, though in its profound reappraisal of his methods 
        and materials it can also be seen as representing an intensely emotional 
        rediscovery of the lessons he had first learnt at his mother’s feet. A 
        conversation with a leading expert/painter in the traditional gouache 
        techniques of Rajastan led him to start exploring the use of pure inorganic 
        pigments bound gum Arabic (from the neem tree) and mixed with water and 
        the use of their traditional wasli paper, then still being handmade in 
        a village near Jaipur.</p>
      <p>The saturated density, range and brilliance of colours he now achieved 
        in these large landscape watercolours, painstakingly ground from rocks 
        and minerals by hand or derived from plant or tree-bark sources (five 
        different yellow from mangoes for example!) seems to have caught even 
        Sidharth by surprise, leading him, in 2003, to embark on the even more 
        symbolically ambitious sequence of the Baramaha paintings, twelve works 
        which take up a theme which has, over many hundreds of years, provided 
        the starting point not only for Persian and Rajasthani painters but poets, 
        musicians, dancers and philosophers among others. That he brings it to 
        such a moving and exhilarating conclusion not only says much about his 
        poetic understanding of his human and cultural experience - ancient scriptures, 
        meteorological patterns, astronomy, human nature - but also of how, employing 
        freedom that come very much from modern times, these same understanding 
        can be subsumed and expressed in colours and materials made from that 
        same natural world from which they were first derived. You can imagine 
        Sidharth nodding agreement with that arch – modernist of post-war Western 
        art, Robert Rauschenberg, when he observed “I think a picture is more 
        like the real world when it’s made of real world”.<br><br>
