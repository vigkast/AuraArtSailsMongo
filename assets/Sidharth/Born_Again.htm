    <p>Sidharth, a multi talented creative and colourful personality with a 
        remarkably checkered career, has led a life full of turns and twists that 
        make this born again artist's story full of mystique, that gets mirrored 
        in his art. Traversing from realistic figuration to ritualistic work, 
        classical imagery to abstract installations, folk idiom to international 
        contemporary sensibility, his repertoire includes painting, print making, 
        writing poetry, composing music, singing, sculpting, calligraphy, drawing, 
        filming and now a unique creative genre that is an assimilation of these 
        varied streams. From humble beginnings as a child assistant to a wall 
        painter he has turned out to be an internationally acclaimed artist exhibited 
        and collected extensively. <br>
	<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/Sidharth/images/birds.jpg" /><br>
<strong>The early track</strong> <br>
        The journey however has not been a straight forward or an easy one. When 
        I first met the artist nearly three decades ago, he was still at Chandigarh, 
        struggling to find his feet on a new ground of urban artistic practice 
        and lingo. But for someone so deeply rooted in to the soil, putting behind 
        the learning from real life until then, was not to be. Instead of flowing 
        with the current, he changed it to suit his own philosophy and creative 
        track. The work he created as a young lad working under various masters 
        including wall paintings, murals, sculptures, portraits and installations 
        using traditional and natural materials helped to sharpen his academic 
        skills in working with pen, pencil, water colours, pastels, oil, papier-mache' 
        and tempera at a later stage in his career. </p>
      <p>Some of the childhood learning and memories are replayed in his early 
        work- such as the old havelis in charcoal drawings, the village festivities 
        around Baisakhi in many of his paintings or the dogs that gave him company 
        wherever he went, in the series that he did during his lonesome days in 
        Chandigrah. There are portraits of Sikh gurus including the one he made 
        when just 8 years old, influenced by what he had seen at the Golden Temple 
        Gurudwara when on a pilgrimage to Amritsar with his mother. </p>
      <p>In the 80s and 90s he painted a large body of work in an amazing series 
        entitled hop scotch that replayed his love for nature through his reinterpretation 
        of the game he played as a child. Socio-political concerns such as the 
        riots and violence of 1984 also featured in his work. The series of multimedia 
        installations in the rag ball series recalled his childhood memories of 
        working with his mother. But what followed in neti neti, or neither this 
        nor that series, was about his philosophy of meditative life and an egoless 
        spirit. The germination of his interest in natural elements and seasons 
        was perhaps a natural corollary to the series that subsequently followed 
        as Panchtatva. </p>
	<p>	
 <strong>Baramasa</strong> <br />
        Sidharth seems to have found his nemesis in the vast and varied repertory 
        around Baramasa or Baramaha that continues to resonate though his work. 
        Rotating around the twelve months or seasons of the year, his ensemble 
        in the series runs through most of his creativity of the last decade or 
        so. In terms of its philosophy, aesthetics and matrix the work springs 
        from the artist's learnings of Guru Granth Sahib and other mystical traditions 
        of the world. <br>
      <br><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/Sidharth/images/mangotree.jpg"  align="left"><br>Known for making his own colours, paper and canvases from minerals, vegetables 
        and other organic sources, his fascination and study of nature gets variously 
        reflected in the distinct- Rooh (spirit/mood), Rung (colours/flora &amp; 
        fauna), Roop (image/weather) and Rachna (life/creation), of each season. 
        Depicting the changing pattern of nature and the physical landscape, it 
        celebrates the changing seasons, time, mood and the resulting life pattern 
        and consciousness. Mirroring the inner state of human mind corresponding 
        to the changing weather it focuses on the continuum of life cycle: birth- 
        life- death and rebirth in the series. </p>
      <p>Starting with Chayet perceived as the time for harmony and renewal his 
        canvases depict birds singing, flowers in full glory and the seeds taking 
        roots. Baisakh referred to as Sona or gold is depicted as the season when 
        life, death and rebirth happen simultaneously. Jaith which literally means 
        'bigger' is the season when the sun is at its peak closer to the earth 
        giving us long stretched days of burning heat. The artist uses the metaphor 
        of a herd of wild elephants to depict hot winds as the birds are shown 
        to perch under the shades of the few firmly rooted surviving trees and 
        when only the restless soul burnt with desire, be it for love or power, 
        dares to step out. In Asaad which to the artist implies 'asha hui' he 
        paints dark ominous clouds, suggesting that the Gods above will soon relent 
        and shower the earth with blessings for life to flower again. In Sawan 
        the divine rains bless the earth bringing nature and the habitat alive 
        all around - with insects buzzing, lightening and thundering of clouds, 
        peacock dancing as the earth and sky meet- like two lovers. The strong 
        winds and pouring rain of Bhadon depict the season's duality as the image 
        resonates with excitement together with an uneasy feel of a lurking danger 
        marked by lightening and fallen trees. Aasun that to quote the artist 
        "says... come, listen, and quietly is a time for sthirta", and calmness 
        to search within. </p></td>

      <p>Katake or Kartik with temperate weather- neither cold nor hot as the 
        earth turns green and the sky blue - all clean and pure, is replayed as 
        a season of resurrection, happiness and nirvana. Manghar- is time for 
        story telling and home coming as the cold weather commences while Poukh 
        with short lived days and nights long, is a time to hibernate and seek 
        warmth. Maagh the month of rebirth is marked for the seeds sown to start 
        sprouting in the imagery while Falgun as the lyrical month of colour, 
        music and ecstasy when life blooms all around with flowering trees, singing 
        waters, dancing skies and awakening of the soul. </p>
      <p><strong>The cow series</strong> <br />
        Retaining his distinct thrust for lyrical figuration in balanced compositions 
        with fine textures and renderings in delicate palette, comes his current 
        work with its thrust focusing on the cow. Instead of the human figure 
        it is now the grace and beauty of the cow with its own character and compulsions 
        that inundate his art frame. </p>
      <p>Sidharth's most recent muse the cow is a take-off on the four legged 
        creature's place in Indian psyche, history, myth, celebration and reality. 
        Regarded as a sacred symbol and a holy animal as Kama Dhenu- she is the 
        nurturing, nourishing mother or wishing cow. Its male form the bull or 
        Nandi is revered for its masculine powerful image as Lord Shiva's vahan. 
        There are numerous legends and creative expressions in Indian literature 
        and art around Radha Krishna's love stories set against a romantic landscape 
        and playfulness of the occasion including Krishna's youthful shepherding. 
        Cow is also a symbol of compassion and feminine docility as perceived 
        even today. </p>
      <p>Dedicating the series to legendry Manjeet Bawa who mastered the art of 
        painting cow in its myriad forms and romantic moods, Sidharth attempts 
        to re-locate the sacred symbol into a contemporary context by placing 
        it in today's urban setting. All decked up but abandoned by the devotees, 
        once she turns unproductive, the sacred cow is shown wondering through 
        the city streets as a metaphor of diminishing compassion, disregard for 
        the environment, prevalent hypocrisy and inaction of the onlooker in post 
        modern India. The unconcerned gaze is explored in new series of paintings, 
        sculptures and a short silent film that follows the holy cow in the urban 
        jungle. Tiptoeing around in its attempts to survive on the cross roads 
        amidst traffic, the cow is shown to engage in playful interactions of 
        a different kind. Instead of gopis or gwalas, she is seen in the company 
        of rag pickers or surrounded by cars and traffic. Meandering through the 
        uncaring city and trying to avoid getting trampled over, she is obliged 
        to live on heaps of garbage, chewing plastic instead of the green grass 
        of Vrindavan! </p>
      <p>What seems amazing is the artist's ability to paint these two very different 
        series in trademarks imagery in his inimitable style that makes it instantly 
        recognizable. So what is this style and what are some of the recurrent 
        features in Sidharth's art? The section below is an attempt to explore 
        and articulate some such strands that are distinctive of his art and aesthetics. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Recurring features</strong><br />
        Using motifs from the Indian philosophic and literary traditions, folk 
        culture, history and techniques in his own unique vision and in an androgynous 
        form, the artist's work evokes the spiritual. As extolled in Sikh, Buddhist, 
        Christian, Hindu, Sufi and all other sacred texts it attempts to awaken 
        the soul. There are celestial creatures in flying postures, with embedded 
        images of nature, its flora and fauna in one form or another created with 
        organic material. Meditative in spirit his oeuvre is pleasing and festive 
        in a mix of earthy and bright hues. It is joyous even in its subtle forms 
        and softer tones represented in a cohabitation of movement and stillness. 
        The layered imagery is heightened with fine lines and scrapings in variable 
        transparency and textures highlighting its links with folk and classical 
        culture and traditional techniques in synergy with changing times. Though 
        love is omnipresent in his oeuvre, there is no explicit expression of 
        sexuality or man-woman sagas of love. </p>
 <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/Sidharth/images/deer.jpg" / align="right">     <p>The most distinct feature of Sidharth's artistic oeuvre is his figuration. 
        Often lonesome and poignant, more universal and not culture specific, 
        it is personified in a sphinx like androgynous form, dressed in long flowing 
        robes, always nose less as is often the case with ancient statues due 
        to ravages of time or human vandalism. Oval shaped face with beautiful 
        lips and large dove like eyes, half open or closed, it adorns a silent 
        look as if in dhyan mudra. Sitting or reclining or standing his figure 
        set amidst nature comes as an assimilation of male and female, orient 
        and west, sensitive and beautiful but not erotic. There are glimpses of 
        Nanak or Christ or Buddha or a saint may be Sufi, Chinese or Japanese 
        or possibly Madonna in a profile that reflects a peace of mind, timelessness, 
        sublimation of the ego and a touch of the Tantric perhaps Ardh Narishwar. 
        Placed amidst trees under the open sky it appears devoid of any past or 
        future, pain or joy. Nothingness pervades the mood as the pristine simplicity 
        and beauty of the form endows it with a Zen and weight-less, lyrical and 
        spiritual, tender and vulnerable appearance and spirit. </p>
      <p>Sidharth's palette for which he searches far and wide, collecting natural 
        pigments to make his own organic colours with minerals, vegetables, flowers, 
        barks, fruits, plants, clay, chalk mitti and stones; is another distinguishing 
        feature of his art. His palette in smooth silken brush strokes flows in 
        a rhythm, like variations of a song or a rainbow, as composite creatures 
        belonging to another outer world of his imagination emerge or hide through 
        contours of the landscape of his canvases. Washing, grinding and mixing 
        his organic finds painstakingly and lovingly, he toils to get the choicest 
        colours and shades that befit his concept and imagery for each painting. 
        His black comes from Petra rocks or lamp black, crimson from pomegranate 
        seeds, blue and green is extracted from Indigo, mustard is used for his 
        yellow while it is also extracted from urine of cows fed on mango leaves, 
        orange from Mansal rock in Orissa, kirmach from Rajasthan while dusty 
        and browns from iron oxides. Lapis Lazuli, Emerald and Turquoise stone 
        are grinded to enrich the palette. There is also a liberal use of gold 
        in his work that comes from Germany, Austria and Sweden, while a particular 
        shade of green he gets from Tibet. </p>
      <p>Besides the use of natural bounty, it is his ability to adapt traditional 
        materials, methods and tools and re-work proven folk techniques of murals, 
        thangka and miniature paintings to suit his contemporary style, that give 
        his art its special appeal. He creates his own handmade 'Wasli' paper 
        and canvas. Jute is soaked for weeks, then mashed and mixed with rice 
        water spread on chhajli (sieve) before it is beaten into thin sheets and 
        then layers are added to give it a desired thickness. The resulting paper 
        is not only acid free but it also remains in-tact for long period with 
        no fading or dis-colouring. For binding he applies vegetable glues, gum 
        Arabic and Neem seeds or juice of Bel tree that also work as preservatives. 
        Chalk mixed in distilled water on handmade paper with a paste of ground 
        stone, adds a jewel like embellishment and a distinct hue to his work 
        with its special appeal and a personal touch that also retains a freshness 
        and brilliance, meticulously matching the mood and mystique of the season 
        or issue or story. </p>
      <p>The artist is an engaging story teller and each of his creations is immersed 
        in layered and folded narratives that try to evoke a long forgotten moment/memory 
        or present a thought or an idea or bring up an issue confronting the individual 
        or society. Each form or colour in his imagery has a story to tell and 
        Kahania or baatan as he calls them reverberate through all his work. His 
        motifs, metaphors and markings alongside the calligraphic writing, flora 
        and fauna rotate around srishti and a play of the five elements or Panchtatva. 
        Deeply rooted in its philosophical strand, the intrinsic merit of his 
        narrative art comes from the heart. It brings forth contemporary concerns 
        around human emotions and environment but sans any expression of alienation, 
        imitation or malice. </p>
      <p>Sidharth's awareness of the global scene and his technology savvy streak 
        also get reflected in his art. With his indefatigable versatility he dabbles 
        with equal 'elan and interest in visual and performing arts and continues 
        to experiment and search for more. His multi disciplinary open minded 
        assimilatory approach involves using a range of media- painting, calligraphic 
        inscriptions, gouache, drawings sculpture, installations, painted scrolls, 
        design, architecture, literature, music, films and new media. It is his 
        holistic integration of various styles, media and influences that churn 
        out his unique form and oeuvre. This mix of styles and influences though 
        occasionally criticized, in fact manifests his versatility and mature 
        appreciation of each medium. The dynamics of human mind and natural phenomena 
        that he has encountered and experienced in personal life, his studies 
        and research over the years have all impacted on his art.</p>
      <p><strong>The born again persona</strong> <br />
        Winding back to the very beginning of the born again artist we encounter 
        Sidharth nee Harjinder Singh nick named Cuckoo, a little boy born to a 
        frail mother Rukmani Bibi and burly ghursaz father Jagtar Singh who worked 
        for the local landlord. The middle one amongst six kids in a Sikh family 
        of Gurbani singers with meager resources but strong cultural roots, he 
        grew up in the interiors of rustic Punjab at Bassian pind near Barnala. 
        With no schooling he led a carefree life listening to the melodious singing 
        of Kabir, Nanak and Baba Farid's religious songs. He loved helping his 
        mother tend the animals and make papier mache toys and dolls for which 
        they collected natural pigments from Sutluj and Bias river beds and the 
        fields around. Sidharth and his siblings saw very little of their father 
        who was often away traveling for his landlord master from one village 
        to another. </p>
      <p>The young lad apprenticed with several masters including Tara Mistry 
        , from whom he learnt white washing, preparing and colouring walls, painting 
        frescos and murals, working on bill boards and decorating doors and havelis 
        . Wanting to expand his horizon, at 14, he left home and landed at Andretta 
        in Kangra where he worked as an assistant to Sardar Shobha Singh learningportraiture 
        and drawing .A subsequent chance visit to Mcleodgunj in Dharamshala saw 
        him give up his sikh identity and turn a Buddhist lama, living the life 
        of a monk at Namgyal monastery, practicing mediatation and learning Thangka 
        painting.It was here that he was rechristened as Sidharth . Life took 
        another U-turn for the wanderer when the restless soul in him decided 
        to give it all up and return to his roots in the village. But rejected 
        by the family, he found himself on the road once again that took him to 
        Chandigarh. Given his resilient spirit and hi quest for learning he joined 
        the art college there for some formal training and gain respectability. 
        In fact this hard working ans passionate artist's adventures also include 
        a short lived experience in Sweden where he came face to face with western 
        art and learnt glassglowing technique, before shifting his base back to 
        India.</p>
      <p>A chance assignment to design a house in Gaziabad near Delhi resulted 
        in the homeless artist getting formally adopted by late Ram Kishen Dass 
        Bajaj and his family, moving into the very house he was designing for 
        them. A period at Garhi Artists' Studios in the city of working in lithography 
        and etching was followed by a difficult phase of struggle at personal 
        and professional levels. But given Sidharth's ability to survive against 
        odds and his commitment to art, he managed to emerge a winner. With a 
        series of exhibitions to his credit and finally his marriage to Devangi 
        and their life together now with young daughter Gaurja- it has been an 
        incessant struggle at various levels for this born again artist and adventurous 
        persona , before he could find a place for himself under the sun.<br />
        The maverick artist's stints as a visualizer with an ad agency, then learning 
        about miniature tradition in Rajasthan, craft techniques including paper 
        making at the Crafts Museum, designing houses, studying and filming Indian 
        classical and temple architecture, composing music- all manifest his quest 
        and resilience that make him a multi talented and born again artist. The 
        large and impressive repertoire of drawings, paintings and now some amazing 
        life size sculptures of birds and cows in fibre glass as well as his new 
        media work in film and music shows a maturity of the prolific artist's 
        vision and the depth of his symbolic and allegorical visual language. 
        A master of many languages and scripts- Persian, Pali, Sanskrit, Swahili, 
        Tibetan and Gurmukhi besides English and Hindi, he has also learnt calligraphy 
        and studied astronomy and the solar system besides folk memory and tales. 
        The strength of his work comes from his mastery of the philosophy, aesthetics 
        and techniques of oriental art which he is able to assimilate comfortably 
        with a contemporary sensibility and awareness and his versatile handling 
        of various materials and matrix.<br>

        For someone who learnt to read and write at a much later stage in life, 
        his in-depth research Ayurvedic tradition, classical scriptures, studies 
        of plants and insects, traditional methods of colour making seem very 
        remarkable. It is his learning from life and self study of various philosophies 
        and techniques that have sharpened his mind and helped shape his art The 
        artist and his art were the subject of an informal discussion that took 
        place recently at the ArtsI Gallery when its dynamic director Mukesh Panika 
        together with writer Namita Gokhle and I met up with Sidharth in the presence 
        of a Darirc film unit and Manoj Tripathi Editor of the Creative Mind when 
        the multi talented artist sang for us and talked about his work being 
        incomplete without a number of other mediums, "Stories, poetry, music- 
        all contribute to my aesthetics". Admiring the neutrality and malleability 
        of the gallery space, we discussed the importance of the vernacular. Also 
        the need for an assimilation of the folk and classical with modern, a 
        current running through much of Sidharth's own creative out pouring. </p>
      <p>The checkered life and predilections of this self taught highly driven 
        artist, thinker, musician and kind hearted persona- born and reborn -  
        from a vagabond to a Buddhist monk and finally an artist of international 
        repute - seem to have influenced the metaphors of his art and shape his 
        aesthetics that resurrect his amazingly varied personal experiences, his 
        intuitive and humanist fortitude and spiritual bent of mind, crisscrossing 
        many interesting turns and twists. As Sidharth's insatiable thirst for 
        learning and exploring continues to refine his form and technique, his 
        art with its subtle quality, unique style, vocabulary and vision that 
        echoes a Zen spirit, innocence, beauty and naive romanticism will hopefully 
        continue to augment its universal appeal. </p>
