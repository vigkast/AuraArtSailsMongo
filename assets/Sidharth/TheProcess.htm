    <td rowspan="3" colspan="3" valign="top"><h1>The Process</h1>
      <p> <strong>MATERIALS</strong></p>
      <p> The process of grinding, of preparing colours brings the artist directly 
        in touch with the spirit of his materials, and the emanation of the hues 
        with which he shall paint. “Extracting juices of fruits, flowers and leaves 
        merge the self in layers of colour.”<br />
        <br />
        To fix and bind the paints, which he has thus created, he uses traditional 
        glues. Then applies linseed oil and coats them, as if a varnish, with 
        egg tempera, imparting sheen reminiscent of traditional masters.</p>
      <p><br />
        <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/Sidharth/images/pigments.jpg" width="192" height="192" / align="left">Dexterous 
        with any material ground he chooses, Sidharth has worked on all sorts 
        of paper, canvas, and silk. Aside from canvas, he works on handmade paper 
        (wasli) from Saganer, in the area around Jaipur, Rajasthan. Developed 
        from jute, this paper is made in the centuries old traditional way; spread 
        on a sieve made of horse hair, then the pulp is beaten until it is extremely 
        fine. The local women lift up the pulp and affix it to walls for drying. 
        Then it is set with local binding agents. Sidharth further evolves the 
        contemporary practice by developing new strengths of paper and fibre content 
        in collaboration with the paper makers.</p>
      <p>Brushes, rollers, styluses, pencils, pens, all range of implements that 
        can be deployed by the hand find their place in his creative unfoldings. 
        Sometimes he combines spatulas and ink transfer rubber rollers of diverse 
        sizes and shapes. Consequently, the lines and compositions in his work 
        reveal an astonishing breadth of detail and narrative iconography.</p>
      <p><strong>SIDHARTH ON COLOURS</strong> <br />
        <br />
        <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/Sidharth/images/pigments1.jpg" width="192" height="96" / align="left"> “Every 
        painting has its own life, its own world like an individual, colours talk 
        to me and they appear with different forms, they bring other elements 
        to tell a story which then evolves into a painting! Colours have their 
        own characteristics, landscapers and culture. One understands their history 
        and symbols better when one knows their origin and source. Colours have 
        a psychological impact on every individual in a different manner according 
        to their geographical situation and nature.”<br>

        <strong>STUDIO</strong><br />
        <br />
        Reflective of the artist’s spirit and embrace of materials from throughout 
        the natural and organic world, Sidharth’s studio balances the essences 
        of what exist with what shall unfold. Palettes of colour, rows upon rows 
        of jars filled with fascinating elements, bursting with texture and imagination, 
        and his tools are all visible surrounding the working table and easels.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>EARLY INFLUENCES AND INSPIRATION</strong><br />
        <br />
        Sidharth’s mother inculcated in him a spirit of connection with nature 
        and the divine. She explored surrounding rural areas of their village 
        in the Punjab, culling organic materials from which to make colour and 
        forge her own individualist artworks. <br />
        He describes how she would beat the papier-mache, ‘providing support with 
        one hand and beating with the other.’ Then she would dissolve gum arabica 
        from babool trees situated in adjacent marshes and leave it to sit for 
        several days. Afterwards adding earth colours, such as red and yellow 
        soil, multhani and seina clays, indigo, assorted leaves and flora, as 
        well as chalk. The latter she used to decorate her myriad creations in 
        floral and arabesque like designs.<br />
        Thus, his earliest creative forays embraced the energy in his own home. 
        “ Mixing holi colours with gum arabica and taking colours from my mother’s 
        terracotta bowls, I made as few floral motifs, a banyan tree, dove, sparrow, 
        berry, bush, pigeon, mango, guava, brinjal, fields, flowers, oxen, the 
        calves…and no more pages were left in my mathematics exercise book.”<br />
