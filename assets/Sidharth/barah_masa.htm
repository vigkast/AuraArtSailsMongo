    <td rowspan="3" colspan="3" valign="top"><h1>Sushma Bahl in conversation 
        with Sidharth on Barahmasa </h1>
      <p><strong>Your work over the last many years has been centered around the 
        theme of Baramasa. Could you please tell us a bit about the essence of 
        Barahmasa and what it means to you? How did your interest in this subject 
        begin and when?</strong></p>
      <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/Sidharth/images/tree.jpg" width="150" height="192" / align="right">
	  <p>For centuries,  
      poets all over the world have been writing about the rhythmic changes and 
      evolving patterns of the seasons. Besides our own literary masters,  we find 
      poets across the Orient from Iran,  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  Sri Lanka,  Thailand,  
      China and the Zen Masters,  attempting to describe in words,  the constantly 
      evolving seasons and the cosmological changes. For me however,  'Barahmaha' 
      found its true meaning only around the 16th century,  when it began to be 
      seen as a key to self awareness,  to Nirvana in the preaching of saints and 
      gurus as they recreating the magic of the seasons in words. </p> 
      <p>My search in this domain began around...when... I attempt to portray it 
        at various levels and in different forms through my art and imagination. 
        To me,  human awareness,  human consciousness changes with seasons...it finds 
        its own as the season evolves... Through , my work,  I search for that elusive 
        peace,  the awakening...a state where one is at peace with one's environment 
        and with ones own self...a state where there is no joy...no pain...no anger...no 
        hatred...no love...a state where one is free of 'self'...the 'Chait awastha'...A 
        state of quiet acceptance and awareness. </p>
      <p><strong>Yes,  the meditative essence and beauty of your work is fairly 
        prominent. But I find a marked contrast in its omission of sagas of love 
        that are at the centre of much of early Indian literature on the theme 
        in classical texts such as Kalidasa's Ritusamhar or Jaidev's Geet Govind. 
        How would you explain that? </strong></p>
      <p>A soul filled with devotion,  can see love all around,  sharing this boundless 
        love,  beyond the human.. Omnipresent. To love the self is the state of 
        "Chayet" the awakening. In this awareness of self , where is the dichotomy? 
        The great poets,  abundant,  overflowing,  perceive their beloved And immersed 
        in that passion create sublime works. Sometimes becoming the lover sometimes 
        exalting the beloved. Their symbols and metaphors are of this world,  the 
        language of expression is of the people. There is not much difference. 
        Only the answer varies,  metaphors are different .The journey to the path 
        of realization is the same. </p>
      <p><strong>Tell us something about your perception of different seasons 
        of Barahmasa and what each one means to you and how? </strong></p>
      <p>This is the season of 'Chayet' when the birds are singing in quiet harmony,  
        the serene waters flow,  the flowers have bloomed to their full glory...and 
        now,  seeds are forming ...the seeds that may pave the way for another season. 
      </p>
      <p>'Waisakh' or Vaibhav Shakha as its called in Sanskrit language. The season 
        is also referred to as 'Sona' or gold and 'Mrityu'...which is death in different 
        other language. A season where life and death are simultaneous. The seeds 
        of Chaitra have died to give birth to a new awareness ...with a sense of 
        waiting...of hope...of expectation...when all around you is slowly wilting. 
        The trees are beginning to shed,  the waters are receeding,  the birds have 
        quietened too and so has the sky...quiet and somber,  and,  all around is 
        the sheer brilliance of gold reflected in the golden grain of wheat in 
        the fields. </p>
      <p>'Jaith'... literally means 'Bigger'. To me,  it's also the Surya or the 
        Sun at the peak of its glory,  its heat...for the sun has inched its way 
        closer to the earth,  the days are stretching and the heat burning...like 
        the heart and the soul of an ambitious worldly man...emanating only scorching 
        heat. A restless burning soul,  burning of desire...money...power. There is 
        restlessness all around and,  heat... harsh and ruthless...tormented skies and 
        burning souls on earth. </p>
      <p>'Asaad'...means 'aasha hui' or in other words 'hope arises'. Just as 
        the heat reaches its peak in the month of Jaith,  and burns up the earth ...what 
        survives is one that's firmly rooted to the earth...the heat has left nothing 
        but a vacuum that storms rage in with all their fury to fill just like 
        a herd of wild elephants...the thunderstorms,  dark ominous clouds,  raging 
        waters...with the hope that soon the Gods above will relent and shower this 
        earth with their blessings and soon life will flower again. </p>   <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/Sidharth/images/peacock.jpg" width="150" height="82" align="left">
      <p>'Sawan' ...The earth is blessed again ...the divine rains have given life 
        to all around us...the trees,  the waters,  the mountains,  the skies. Life 
        is young and green again bringing with it a sense of energy and fulfillment. 
      </p>
        <p>'Bhadon' depicts a duality of the season's characteristics. The second 
        month of 'Sawan' on the one hand brings excitement,  life and abundance 
        while on the other there are thundering skies and somewhere,  a lurking 
        fear of the past...of over abundance. </p>
      <p>'Aasun'...come,  listen,  quietly. Its quiet and calm outside...try and find 
        it within you too. Hold on to your restless spirit and listen. Listen 
        to the quiet harmony of nature,  to the song of your own spirit. A time 
        to listen and imbibe the stability and the stillness ...the 'sthirta'. </p>
      <p>'Katke' a month when the skies have cleared,  all insects and reptiles 
        prepare to move in to their holes. Kartik brings with it soft,  pleasant 
        and cool air. A time to clean up your home,  to decorate it and prepare 
        to welcome Ram,  to welcome your own self and your soul...a season of correction.</p>
      <p>'Manghar'...a time to come home.A time for fairytales,  of story telling...searching...a 
        time to be with one's own self. When the birds are on their way home and 
        the skies are beginning to get cold. This is the time to remain inside 
        ones own space. </p>

      <p><strong>What I find central to much of your work specially in the Baramaha 
        series is also your use of hand made materials specially the paper,  canvas 
        and mineral or vegetable pigments. It seems integral to your work ethos. 
        Did your interest in the subject prompt the use of organic materials or 
        was it your fascination and expertise in making your own colours and material 
        that fuelled your interest in the theme? </strong></p>
      <p>You have rightly said that I mostly use handmade materials and have been 
        doing so since my early years .I have learned that to seek colours from 
        nature is a meditative exercise in itself. Nature is copious in its bounty. 
        To take from nature what it so generously offers,  to assimilate its richness 
        and represent it via the medium of colours derived from it has been my 
        artistic endeavor. The images and metaphors that I use originate form 
        natural life forms. When an understanding of a colour and its source is 
        attained,  a bond,  an attachment to it is formed. It cannot then be disparaged 
        or unjustly dealt with. To me,  art is an expression of peace and tranquility.</p>
      <p> In working on this theme of "BarahMaha",  it has been my aspiration to 
        portray the life forms distinctive to each season - be it birds or flowers 
        or indeed the whole world and it's changing landscape,  the experiences 
        and ebb and flow of life. In the rendition of each season,  I have tried 
        to source the colours from the flora and fauna peculiar to that time of 
        the year and like an Ayurvedic doctor,  perceive and gain awareness of 
        their essence and transmute them pictorially. </p>
      <p><strong>Do you see any link or connectivity between your earlier work 
        and the Barahmasa series? If so,  what? </strong></p>
      <p>One grows in years,  times change and awareness waxes and wanes. When 
        one is constantly working through a medium,  the medium itself becomes 
        a guiding force. This has been my experience. From embellishing stately 
        homes in my early years to depiction of the serene Gurus,  portraying the 
        calmness of Buddha in Thangka paintings , then onto the maternal softness 
        of Madonna. In my paintings,  the human element is represented sometimes 
        as standing solitary in a void,  or part of a queue on a bus-stop,  as a 
        child playing hopscotch,  skipping,  dancing,  bounding,  playing cosmological 
        games,  Lively enduring forms or sometimes as a lifeless entity,  chaos 
        , terrorism- these are all part of my environment. To gain deeper awareness 
        of this shifting worldscape,  the "Barah Maha " series is crucial,  there 
        is a single unifying thread between previous and In my entire body of 
        work- being one with nature - the search for peace and realization. </p>
      <p><strong>And what does Barahmaha mean to you? How would you like to describe 
        its Rooh Rung Roop Rachna as reflected in your work?</strong></p>
      <p> For me, 'Barahmaha' has been a journey. One of seeing things in my environment 
        that otherwise I may not have done,  of comprehending and understanding 
        the play of each season on nature...on life...my environment...and,  myself. 
        Its been a journey of self discovery...of knowing that just like that flower 
        blooming in the spring,  I am blooming too...in my full pristine glory today. 
        Someday,  I too shall produce seeds that would,  perhaps lay down the path 
        of the seasons to come. I also see a tiny leaf falling off a tree,  with 
        the knowledge that someday,  I too will fall... </p>
      <p><strong>I find your figuration more universal and less specific. Often 
        located amidst natural surroundings in a sort of trance and dressed in 
        long flowing robes. It looks amazing though always appears nose less. 
        What is the take behind that? </strong></p>
      <p>History has witnessed much turbulence - enmity,  violence,  greed,  hatred- 
        man against man and against nature. It is an ongoing battle. To counteract 
        these forces,  man has tried to create countless devices to increase his 
        comforts and make his surroundings pleasant- elegant homes,  comfortable 
        furniture,  a variety of apparel,  musical equipment,  computers,  ease giving 
        drugs,  aero planes and cars etc. Despite this,  human nature being what 
        it is,  creates uncomfortable situations and tries to balance it by surrounding 
        itself with a harmonious environment. In actuality,  the only wish is for 
        peace and survival. </p>
      <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/Sidharth/images/man.jpg" width="142" height="163" / align="left">My paintings deal with 
        this most basic human aspiration. To portray serenity and the endurance 
        of the human spirit,  at the same time to convey harmony with nature and 
        create this awareness is my wish. Maybe,  at a subconscious level,  this 
        is how I would like the world to be. </p>
      <p>It is often seen that the ancient statues in rock temples have broken 
        noses - maybe the ravages of nature and time or the result of vandalism. 
        In life,  man pokes his nose where it does not belong and is disfigured 
        in the process , he cuts off his nose to spite his face or sometimes seeks 
        to disfigure others in the same manner. Metaphorically speaking the injury 
        caused is to the ego,  to human arrogance. Keeping all these connotations 
        in mind,  I decided to do away with painting it altogether. </p>
      <p>My work portrays the tranquil being,  at one with his surroundings,  assimilating 
        his environment - swaying with the trees and undulating with the grass. 
        Where there is human presence it is with complete egolessness. There is 
        only one melody - a yearning for harmony. </p>
      <p><strong>And what is next on the horizon for you? Do you feel you have 
        reached your peak? In what direction you see your work going in the next 
        few years? </strong></p>
      <p>One is always standing at the peak of the present. From this vantage 
        point,  there is always another peak visible,  a mountain that the human 
        mind aspires to scale and which is seldom attainable because that lofty 
        summit is beyond the scale of human endeavour. Nobody can foretell the 
        future. What will be is unknown - one can only hope and yearn. As in a 
        mountain trek,  traversing an unknown path,  one chances suddenly upon a 
        babbling brook,  or a tranquil pond,  a constricting track or open spaces,  
        a snarling animal or placid herds,  sometimes cooling showers or unrelenting 
        sun. The traveler progresses towards his destination,  at least he knows 
        where his journey ends,  but in my work,  nothing is certain. I only wish 
        for my quest to proceed tirelessly and that I continue to create. Other 
        than this,  I know nothing. </p></td><td width="298">&nbsp;  </td></tr></table>
