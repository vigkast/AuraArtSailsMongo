	<h1>Harmeet Singh Sethi, CEO Aura Art<br />
        - Tracks the Rise of Artist Sidharth</h1>
		
      <p> With Sidharth past, present and future coexist. He experiments with 
        forms, images and textures old and new to tell his story, which is often 
        closely linked to classical Indian literature, folk ballads, mythology, 
        music and poetry.<br>
        His journey into mysticism began from early childhood. Zen, Sufism, Osho, 
        Guru Granth Sahib, Tibetan Buddhism and the compassion of Madonna are 
        the many facets of religious thought that have influenced him. There is 
        a very strong spiritual core, which is part of the fabric of his being 
        and is reflected in all his paintings. His work is sophisticated, yet 
        intense …a rare cross-cultural success. Each painting has a very personal, 
        spiritual experience for the viewer, which the artist hopes will lead 
        you to your universal understanding of human culture. <br />
        <br />
        Born in 1956 in Punjab, India, Sidharth started painting sign boards while 
        still at school, but later progressed by learning the Thangka painting 
        technique from the Thibetan monks at Dharmashala, where he spent six years. 
        After his graduation from the College of Art in Chandigarh, he joined 
        a group of painters called ‘Solids’ and exhibited the ‘White Space’ series. 
        Eager to learn different techniques, he studied glass blowing in Sweden, 
        techniques of Madhubani paintings, Kashmir Papier-mâché Crafts and other 
        south Asian and oriental techniques from various master craftsmen.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/Sidharth/images/painting6.gif" / align="left">As an accomplished alchemist and 
        conceiver of distinctive palettes, Sidharth produces his own pigments 
        from natural vegetable sources and minerals, clays, organic chromatics 
        and inorganic pigments. Throughout his travels across India and elsewhere 
        in the world, he visits local markets, herbal suppliers, sources of plant 
        and sea organisms, to enrich the storehouse which characterizes his studio. 
        From a roadside vendor to a traditional trader of Silk Route spices and 
        products, to paint sellers, each corner proffers potential elements. Trees, 
        leaves, barks, berries, loam and lichen, herbs, lava, coral, pearl dust, 
        moon rock, pollen, stamens, iron ores, rarefied and mundane, this endless 
        bouquet of possible hues line his walls. Dexterous with any material ground 
        he chooses.<br />
        <br />
        For centuries, poets all over the world have been writing about the rhythmic 
        changes and evolving patterns of the seasons. Besides our own literary 
        masters, we find poets across the Orient from Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, 
        Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and the Zen Masters, attempting to describe 
        in words, the constantly evolving seasons and the cosmological changes. 
        Sidharth’s search in this domain began around the end of 2005, when he 
        attempted to portray it at various levels and in different forms through 
        his art and imagination. To him, human awareness, human consciousness 
        changes with seasons…it finds its own way as the season evolves through 
        his work, his search for that elusive peace, the awakening, a state where 
        one is at peace with one’s environment and with ones own self, a state 
        where there is no joy…no pain…no anger…no hatred… a state where one is 
        free of ‘self’… A state of quiet acceptance and awareness. </p>
      <p>While working on this theme of “Barah-Maha” (twelve months), it has been 
        his aspiration to portray the life forms distinctive to each season – 
        be it birds, animal, human or flora-fauna and it’s changing landscape, 
        the experiences and ebb and flow of life. In the rendition of each season, 
        he has tried to source the colors from the flora and fauna peculiar to 
        that time of the year. Well known arts writer and curator Sushma K Bahl 
        very aptly states and I quote “Sidharth seems to have found his nemesis 
        in the vast and varied repertory around Baramasa or Baramaha that continues 
        to resonate though his work. Rotating around the twelve months or seasons 
        of the year, his ensemble in the series runs through most of his creativity 
        of the last decade or so. In terms of its philosophy, aesthetics and matrix 
        the work springs from the artist’s learnings of Guru Granth Sahib and 
        other mystical traditions of the world.” </p>
      <p>On his most recent body of work Sushma ji comments “Retaining his distinct 
        thrust for lyrical figuration in balanced compositions with fine textures 
        and renderings in delicate palette, comes his current work with its thrust 
        focusing on the cow. Instead of the human figure it is now the grace and 
        beauty of the cow with its own character and compulsions that inundate 
        his art frame.” <br />
        <br />
        Dedicating the series to legendry Manjeet Bawa who mastered the art of 
        painting cow in its myriad forms and romantic moods, Sidharth attempts 
        to re-locate the sacred symbol into a contemporary context by placing 
        it in today’s urban setting.</p>

      <p>The artist is an engaging story teller and each of his creations is immersed 
        in layered and folded narratives that try to evoke a long forgotten moment/memory 
        or present a thought or an idea or bring up an issue confronting the individual 
        or society. The checkered life and predilections of this highly driven 
        artist, thinker, musician and kind hearted persona- born and reborn – 
        from a vagabond to a Buddhist monk and finally an artist of international 
        repute- seem to have influenced the metaphors of his art and shape his 
        aesthetics that resurrect his amazingly varied personal experiences, his 
        intuitive and humanist fortitude and spiritual bent of mind, crisscrossing 
        many interesting turns and twists. </p>
      <p>He has held eighteen solo shows and has participated in eighty group 
        shows in India, UK, Sweden and USA since 1976. Receiving various awards 
        for his works, including from the British Council. His works have been 
        acquired by the Indian Government Museum, the British Council in Delhi, 
        the Punjab Lalit Kala Akademi, the British, Mexican and Swedish Ambassadors, 
        the Düsseldorf Museum: Heda, Sweden and several industrial groups in India 
        and abroad.</p>
      <p>He is the author of Neti Neti and has made fifteen documentaries on Indian 
        Temples, Art and Architecture.</p>
