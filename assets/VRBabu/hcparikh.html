<b>In Pursuit of Balance</b><br>
<p><i>H C Parikh</i>
<br><br>
Never in the history of mankind, the organic world has faced such an unprecedented crisis of
existence. Our great forests are dying from acid rain, pollution or timber harvesting. Great
rivers, all over, are in the process of decline from toxic wastes. The extinction rate amongst
higher vertebrates is hundreds of times more than the average rate that prevailed over the history of
evolution, seriously endangering the very survival of rare species, whether plants or animals,
threatening to disturb the very Balance of Nature.
<br>
<p>No nation, society or group of people have any right to diminish or devalue the diversity,
complexity or richness of nature's order or beauty of Mother Earth, but, alas, <b>man in the name of
growth and development has caused irreparable damage to the lovely Order of Nature,</b>
degrading the rich forests, cutting beautiful trees, polluting rivers and contaminating natural
sources of water.

Childhood memories are nestled in
and around my village, on the
banks of the river which was really
exotic to view. Though life was a bit
hard, yet, I enjoyed the darkness
sitting near the chulhas at dusk for
dinner. A tasty supper cooked on
logs and sticks, listening to the
unforgettable stories of my
forefathers was really enchanting ..
the look of flowering fields, with a
few mango trees on the corners
was heart-warming and indescribable. The scene is
different now, I bemoan the
prospering of villages at the cost of
traditional ethos of cooperation,
mutual care and tolerance.</p></td></tr></table>

Nature is a masterly creative work of the almighty. It is a ceaseless process going on for
millions and millions of years. It is an infinitely inventive phenomenon of nature, which unfolds
before us the grandest beauty of a most comprehensive order, but man, pursuing the goal of material
well being, has disturbed the balance and in the name of industrial revolution, has done great
disservice to ecological aesthetics, hurting the environment to an extent that now man finds himself
caught in a dilemma as to what he has lost for some tangible material gains.

I cast a little boy sitting
at the top of a ladder, which signifies the steps of success, celebrating the time that has elapsed, while his
future seems to be invisible to the eye. Reality exists somewhere beyond his sight. Cherishing the memories
of his past life in his village and contrasting them with the present urban life, reflects his journey of life and how
far he is from this timeline of the journey.</p></td></tr></table>

Having lost some of the loveliest trees, gardens and forests, man now longs for those open
fields, rich in wild grasses, regaled by the smell of pines and resonating with the soothing sound of
bird songs. He craves for these awe-inspiring glimpses of rivers in a painting mood, laying down a
lovely carpet of moss on its silty edges.<br><br>

Our great thinkers and artists talked of the habit of aesthetic apprehension to grasp the
Beauty of Nature. It is in fact the ability to look beyond the level of isolated details and perceive the
underlying cohesion in the Order of Nature.

<br><br>

Human Art in particular has its primal impulse in the keen observance of Nature and our highly
promising and talented artist, Veguri Ravindra Babu, living in a small village of Andhra Pradesh, grew
up in the company of trees and birds, enjoying nature's majestic company, roaming around fields and
forests and playing around enchanting streams and walking near ever flowing water of a nearby
river. Alas, he saw the shrinking river, felt the pain of loss of friends - friends, yes those big shady
trees, chirpy birds and colourful fishes. Bewildered and hurt, he expressed his anguish and gave vent
to his feelings of betrayal in his lovely paintings.<br><br>

The world of Nature has a Pattern of Order which an artist or lover of Nature should try to
manifest in his creative art. This artist is endowed with such high sense of apprehension and unique
skill of expression that he is able to transmit it through his excellent works which portray those lovely
patterns of beauty discovered in different shades of Nature - constructing harmonies in all the varied
forms, in his captivating landscapes.

<p>His paintings and his installation "Disturbed Landscapes" convey a lofty message. His
portrayal of gradual decline of human sensibilities to achieve hollow economic progress at the
expense of our great Natural Order provokes us to ponder over our painful dilemma. He has bluntly
portrayed victory of market forces over human values which blunted man's ability and sensibility to
value both the services that natural systems provide to man and the aesthetics he enjoys by being in
the Company of Nature.<br><br>
One is overtaken by a sense of awe and delight while viewing his masterly creations of Art
which convey a deeper meaning that the world of Nature has a Pattern of Order. We need to see
through the eyes of the artist those Sublime Shades of Nature which sadly we seem to have forgotten!<br><br>
