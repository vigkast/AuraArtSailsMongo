<b>Chairman's Note</b>
<p>In propagating art, I have had the distinctive pleasure of playing the role of a gardener in more instances than one. In Veguri Ravindra Babu's case, it was the gift of a sapling given to me by the Hands of the Supreme Master and it gave me no small delight to nurture and ensure that this sapling grew into a tree! I recall, this desire of being an extension of God's will, was imbibed from my grandfather, a saint. His principles later came to significantly influence Aura Art's credo, inspiring its chief functionaries to stretch out and help artists of calibre!<br><br>
It was destiny that led Veguri to Aura Art's office at Vadodara. That was in 2006, when
he had just graduated in Fine Arts from Andhra University, Vishakhapatnam and enrolled himself to pursue Masters in Fine Arts at Jamia Millia University, New Delhi. He had little else in his support other than four rolls of canvas paintings. While he was aware of the intrinsic value of his art, few in his hometown or even at Vadodara gave due credit for his work, until Harmeet Singh Sethi, CEO Aura Art, at the behest of a trusted friend, chanced to see his work. Being sensitive to good art and realizing Veguri's potential, Harmeet, in consultation with me, responded more than favourably, opting to purchase outright all the paintings he had brought along with himself... and then there was no looking back.<br><br>
Veguri's first major exposure was at the grand inaugural group show of Aura Art held
at Nehru Centre, Mumbai in 2008, followed soon by his first significant solo show at the
exclusive European Business Group Event at Taj Mahal Hotel, Mumbai in 2009. Thereafter, Veguri's artworks formed an integral part of all significant exhibitions held by Aura Art at key venues across the country.
<br><br>It makes me feel proud today that Veguri Ravindra Babu, besides having made his presence felt at international events, also periodically presents papers at seminars on pertinent issues, writes for publications and is pursuing his Ph.D in Visual Arts at Andhra University.<br><br>
I am indeed very happy that Aura Art eConnect Pvt Ltd has, in due recognition of his
talent, decided to produce Aura Art's very first single artist compilation of Veguri - a
recognition he surely deserves. I look forward to his success now at the international level, giving Indian contemporary art yet another fillip in markets round the world.
