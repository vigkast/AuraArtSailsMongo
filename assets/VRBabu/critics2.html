 <b>Innocence, Consciousness and Realization</b> <br>

<p><i>Dr Seema Bawa</i><br><br>

Veguri Ravindra Babu is one of the <b>most promising young artists in this country</b> and has remained free of pretensions and fashionable fads. He paints with an attractive directness. And he paints what he experiences; thus his work is his response to the urban, post modern world which global in expanse but is filtered through local and regional interaction. 
<br>
<br>

One of the strengths of this artist is the <b>adoption of an expressive culture - language - image system</b> operative in a continuum of visual practices that define the vocabulary, metaphor and style of the artist. His is a very personal speaking voice which gives much of his paintings a dramatic quality.  
<br>
<br>
<table bgcolor="#999" cellpadding="10" align="center" width=95%><tr><td><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/VRBabu/images/186.jpg"><br><greytext># 186, The Saint, Acrylic on canvas, 36 x 48 inches, 2006</greytext></center></td><td>
<p><b>Artist's Thoughts</b><br>
This painting portrays the scene of
a bhikshu and a dog beside, in
spiritual multiversity settings. It
reflects serene life through a vow
of silence, and happiness obtained
through sharing. The Saint
believes in abstinence from injuring
and debt to the cosmic elements.
Hindu scriptures say that every
human being is born with five
important debts: debt to God, debt
to Ancestors, debt to Humankind,
debt to Guests, debt to Animals
and plants and they must repay
those karmic debts during their
lifetime.</td></tr></table><br><br>


The artist's use of cross cultural referencing, perhaps unintentionally, evokes empathy amongst those familiar with the Indian mystical tradition.  A painting that best illustrates this is The Saint with its huddled shadowy mystic seen through a doorway and a dog outside that reminds us of Sultan Bahu's and Baba Bulle Shah's allusions to the fakir's bitch that accompanies him everywhere signifying ego on the sublime level or/and indeed the superiority of dogs over those professing excessive faith at the mundane level. The sacred and profane disjunction is well delineated in the work. 
<br>
<br>

Another painting that deals with the path of renunciation (whether real or shammed) is Hallucination Way. The white robed men and women climbing up a gentle red slope, straining with effort on a religious or perhaps a political quest, that to the artist, seem to represent the searching for or following false prophets. He explicitly engages with the political in Blind Man's Race with blindfolded figures following a dog, perhaps into perdition.

<p><b>Artist's Thoughts</b><br>
The artwork Sound Crowd portrays my "freedom of thought and my solicitation for gratification",
craving to breakthrough those frontiers in the pursuit of peace. Materialistic environment, roaring public, loud noise
in high decibels is having a detrimental effect on life forms. Having a yearning for peace of mind, quietude, serenity,
noise has vented my spleen. In this painting I have portrayed visually, the multi-directional sources of noise we are
subjected to.</td></tr></table><br><br>

Veguri Ravindra Babu's engagement with the contemporary continues as he invokes images of banality and blah factor that permeates our popular culture in some of his works. Sound Crowd and Dump The Uncharismatic FM allude to white noise around us with repetitive sounds (sometimes referred to as music) that lose their distinctive character to become a collective cacophony of sounds that envelop us in our homes, cars and offices. The idle crowing chatter of the radio jockeys adds to this noise without leaving any serious or permanent impact on the listener. FM radio is an eclogue's nightmare.

<br>

Childhood in Delhi, a set of three paintings reflects the sheer joy of being young along with our dichotomous perspective towards certain cultural symbols. The ubiquitous cow, seen on roads, parks or dumps of Delhi is an indicator of the city and its apathy towards ecology, pain, inequality and its double standards on one hand and the children's ingenuous oblivion of all but the cows' potential as playmate on the other. In scorching sun and in rain, against a backdrop of middle class high rise housing, they play with paper boats and ride the cows with abandon.
<br>
<br><br>

<table bgcolor="#ccc" cellpadding="10" align="left"><tr><td bgcolor="#999"><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/VRBabu/images/381.jpg"><br><greytext># 381, Unknown Destiny, Acrylic on canvas, 60 x 84 inches, 2008</greytext></center></td><td width="4">&nbsp; </td></tr></table>
<br><br><br>

The child in his paintings seems to be a generic boy without class or any other indicator of a particular background. The significant elements in these paintings are the circumstances and the emotions: fears, curiosities, concerns and cares, of the child who may be the young artist himself, or perhaps any child of our times or indeed the viewer himself. It is no wonder that the works centering on the child have great emotional appeal while displaying the artist's ability to effectively portray expressions and conditions. In fact, they demonstrate the innate humanism in Babu's oeuvre. 
<br>
<br>

Unknown Destiny is one such painting where the downcast face of the child in the lower right corner is juxtaposed to signifiers of temporal and spatial co-ordinates. Contrasted to this somewhat melancholy or at least careworn work are My Countryside and Bird Song where the joyous and innocent child invokes the urban-rural, agrarian-industrial, nature-craft, grama-nagara-aryanaka divide with the privileging of the first category. Reminiscence with a pink heart lotus and introspective expression refers to the personal innerscape and collective memory.
<br>
<br>

An allusion to childhood memory is strong in his Scared Spirits series and Corneille Pecking where the fear of unknown combined with stories of powerful spirit figures. They also trace his struggle with tribulations of life and the resultant fear from his current relatively secure and tranquil present.

<p><b>Artist's Thoughts</b><br>
During my childhood, I was very fond of
birds that took shelter in the backyard of
our home in the village. As my memories
rewind, we had strange experiences with
these sentient creatures. They never led
us into their territory and whenever we
tried to climb a tree to fetch their eggs,
they would peck us. My fascination for
these creatures gradually declined. These experiences have been
sensitively portrayed on canvas. Viewers
who have had similar experiences in the
past will empathise with this image.</td></tr></table><br><br>

Veguri prefers to <b>use monochromatic tones of black on white interspersed with red</b> to emphasise a particular aspect of the painting. This allows him to play with form and its arrangement with greater freedom. The black and white format lends itself well to the use of text as image and text as metaphor by the artist, both in the background and as commentary. 
<br>
<br>

Thus form and figure are of vital importance in his acrylic on canvas works. The photo-negative-digital nature of his figures is informed by the artist's engagement with the contemporary cultural practices. The voids and whites in his paintings are speaking, and also attest to his excellent understanding and control over spatial dimensions of the surface.
<br>
<br>

Though most of his works are mono-figural, his use of multiple forms in a composition is well arranged and thought out. The lack of interaction between the figures reiterates the artist's vision of an alienated, post modern reality. 
<br>
<br>
Perhaps <b>one of the greatest strengths of Veguri's paintings is their overt simplicity that gradually reveals multiple layers of signifiers</b>. His imagery is direct and simple, despite layers of motifs that provide depth to his work. There is no gimmickry or overt privileging as he explores individual and shared journeys from simple to complex life forms by going back and forth between rural and urban, adulthood and childhood, between hallucination and reality, between the real and memory.

<p><b>Artist's Thoughts</b><br>
This artpiece visualizes my
childhood reminiscence - the
image of a child with a guitar
playing the notes of a vintage
christmas carol. This old carol
always left an everlasting
impression on my mind.
Songs of praise, jubilant
evenings spent at sunset time,
remind me of those halcyon
days. The speaker, carolsinging
boy are all images
from the past, while the
essence of the music remains
eternally within me.</td></tr></table><br><br>
