<b>&nbsp; &nbsp; Disturbed Landscapes: </b>
<p><i>Artist's Thoughts</i>
<br><br>
This installation <b>signifies the disturbances in the environment due to anthropogenic actions and the need to restore our natural beauty of village environment</b> and regain a long term healthy ecosystem. It focuses on the changing face of my village environment and urbanization, the root cause of landscape disturbances eventually <b>leading to species extinction and degeneration of society</b>

<br><br>
<b>In this art work, the use of traditional coal filled hollow iron box depicts the earth's crust.</b> The earth's crust is composed of a variety of rocks - the outer solid crust, underlain by a mantle and solid inner core. Much of our natural resources are deep seated in the earth's crust which we are indiscriminately using up for our benefits to meet up the demands of a growing population which is the principal source of degeneration of our environment. <b>We must realize that nature is exhaustible.</b> So, I think there is a need to replenish our natural resources and regain the beauty and
health of our nature - the central idea of this artwork. <b>I am intending to bring back the lost beauty of earth (village) and the desire to spread greenery everywhere. </b>This is reflected in the hollow iron box filled with coal (a source of carbon), a pollutant which is the principal cause of disturbance to the environment. The use of the traditional iron box suggests our return to those simple, traditional ways that once helped preserve our ecology.<b> Landscape disturbances need to be controlled</b> to enable human habitation, to regain our greenery and lost beauty of our villages. On our march towards progress, with the help of technology, we have no right to destroy nature. <br><br>

Title: Disturbed Landscapes<br>
Size: 108.5 x 81 x 44 inches<br>
Medium: Iron and Wood<br>
Weight: 500 kgs - filled with soil<br>
Year of Creation: 2010<br>
In collaboration with
Vadodara Sculpture Park</greytext>
<br><br>

In a symbolic suggestion that much of the earth should be under cultivation, I have sown
natural seeds focusing on growth, in an effort to initiate a Green Revolution, and recover the lost
beauty of earth. It signifies that the top cover of the earth's crust should be protected from
deforestation and pollution thus increasing the crop yield by bringing more land under cultivation. I
have used natural seeds sown in the soil - filled iron box in line with the natural eco-system. <br><br>
Illegal land acquisition has led to defacing of green lands; also uncontrolled urbanization and
disturbed landscapes have created environmental and spatial disturbances. The bearing capacity of the
earth is now significantly disproportionate to the demands placed on it by the growing population. The
green fields that once enhanced the beauty of my village are no more. Most of the cultivable lands have been transformed into residential plots and mills or factories attracting large number of people to work, resulting
in building of small towns in the last couple of decades. These towns have conjugated into cities leading to
urbanization. The need to improve one's living standard, beyond basic sustenance, is the reason for such
urbanization, which is not possible in small family farms, dependant on unpredictable environmental
conditions. <b>Most of the villagers are uninterested in agricultural practices.</b> The natural vigour and
vitality of the seed is not there, everything is now cultured in laboratories. The hybrids are booming now,
there is no purity in the food we eat and the water we drink. The famous saying that "the grass is always
greener on the other side" is true, as large flocks move to the cities to seek economic opportunities. <br><br>

<b>In creating a concrete jungle, we have destroyed our natural surroundings.</b> We have a ' do not
care' attitude towards nature. Deforestation, industrial growth and effluents from chemical industries have
resulted in degradation of our land and water resources on and under the surface. This has resulted in rivers drying up and marine fauna disappearing from lakes. With advancement in technology, smoke from
motorized vehicles and half burnt coal cause pollution and temperature to rise due to CO emissions, 2
contributing to global warming which is dangerous for life. We, ourselves are the creators of these
disturbances on landscape. Man's ecological footprint is too big to be sustained. The resources on earth
have been exploited by human activities in the last couple of decades at an unimaginable rate. These human
activities within the fluvial corridors have stressed nature, leading to loss of land cover and extinction of
species.<br><br>

Recently, going through a zoological article, I came to know that 25% of bird species have gone
extinct and our national animal, the Tiger is also on the verge of extinction. We cannot find those chirping sparrows building their nests in creeks and crevices of our home. To enable animal habitation, deforestation
should be strictly prohibited and we must consider long term ecosystem health. Afforestation programmes
should be adopted in cities and villages, thus enriching greenery all around. This will reduce suffocation
caused by pollution, purify the air we breathe and resolve problems of soil erosion. To make up for the
follies, there is a need to restore nature and its resources.<b> I think we should adopt a holistic view of nature - it is not an entity that exists separately from us, the nature is us, we are an inalienable part of it and
we should care for it, in the most appropriate manner</b>. Only then can we solve the problem of landscape
and environmental disturbances.</p>
