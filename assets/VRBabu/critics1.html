<b>Negotiating Many Curves: The Art of Veguri Ravindra Babu</b><br>
 <p><i>Johny ML </i><br><br>

At the top end of the painting titled 'A Scintilla of Aurora' by Ravindra Babu Veguri runs this line as an intentional graffiti carefully etched there by the artist. With a clear reference to an existing image that shows a vast empty foreground and horizon line with a row of factories emitting poisonous gas at the background, and a middle ground of pure vastness, which is illuminated by an ethereal glow from the sky, the painting looks absolutely inanimate for a moment till the viewers' eyes fall on the right hand corner, which is obviously the main focus of the painting, where we see a child in a minimal undergarment, pushing her hands backward as if she were moving against a strong current of wind. The child looks like an angel without wings, as Walter Benjamin has observed, 'an ineffectual angel' pushing itself against the strong current of history. The whole painting gets animated by the presence of this figure and the onlookers would wonder what exactly has inspired the artist to position the child in that far right corner.  What could be the possible relationship between a child engaged in a happy struggle against something that she is not able to understand and the factories and the ethereal glow seen in the background and the middle ground respectively? Questions could be far and wide as one stands in front of a painting like this that obviously with the graffiti above states the intentionality of the interpolator/artist.<br>

It personifies human character in decision making. It cogitates, how our priorities in life make us decide our future, which makes all the difference. It introspects our path in life or exactly which door we knock and the dilemma we face in deciding the best pathway in life. A trait of resoluteness surely leads to great consequences.

Apparently, the artist wants to say that this is one moment of 'realization' or it is that one unique but precarious moment where all the angels on earth realize their ineffectuality. It is a struggle against history though the artist feels, at this particular moment or even asks the viewers to feel the same, that it is at this moment that one experiences the spiritual release. <strong>Ravindra Babu's oeuvre shows that he is not new in the creation of a pictorial tension that tends to speak a lot but resists the imparting of meaning completely.</strong> The three entities in the painting, the factories at the horizon, the child in the foreground and the ethereal glow at the middle ground, tell a story and we should see the graffiti as an ironic title. The artist creates an oxymoron using apparently contradicting visuals; the child cannot be really happy about a row of factories, though far away, which have taken clear air away from him even if he is not conscious of it and at the same time the factories cannot be seen as 'demons' that deliberately kill the 'rights' of a child to live breathing unpolluted air. <br>

The series of contradictions that we are living with today comes to play a major role in Ravindra Babu's latest series of paintings that range from the year 2010 to 2012. The subject matter varies as per the mood and period of the artist's engagement with his works though the stylistic features remain more or less the same. Before we go into the varied aspects of his works, it is pertinent to chalk out the philosophical as well as creative concerns that the artist carries along throughout his career so far. <strong>Even without making deliberate connections to the biographical details of the artist, one could make out that what goads Ravindra Babu to his works is his understanding of the complexities involved in the changing nature of 'life' in today's world.</strong> He recognizes the notion of progress as he highlights the presence of the factories and other urbanising as well as globalizing agencies, but he positions his pictorial debates in such a fashion that he problematizes the very notion of progress vis-a-vis his particular identity, as a person who is born and brought up in a culture that worships nature than 'culture'. The theoretical polemics of nature and culture is treated in his works systematically and with an aesthetician's involvement. At the same time, he makes it quite evident that he is not here for an absolute negation of progress as seen in an urban context. He positions himself within the process of criticality, where the critic of anything has to be inside before making a critique of the same. <br>
<br>

This could be viewed as a dilemma or an ideological crisis not only for the artist but also for any human being who is currently living on the earth. While Ravindra Babu nostalgically looks at his own past with reference to the spiritual release that he feels while going through it, he feels that it is always relative and comparative with the existing and evolving realities of the 'living' times. In his works, he strongly addresses this issue of being nostalgic and being contemporary at the same time; and he proves in most of the works that he cannot do away with either for the sake of celebrating the one against the other. <strong>His idea of progress is contemporary but his understanding of the progress is always compared to the spiritual satisfaction of an individual who enjoys the fruits of the progress.</strong> If I take an example of gastronomic pleasures that one enjoys in his or her life and the austerities that one brings in for the sake of maintaining good figure and health, one pertinent question that could be asked to the person who undergoes this aspect of dieting is this: is he or she is happy with the idea and practice of dieting while indulging or abstaining from certain kind of food? The question is all about happiness. One could splurge and be happy without thinking much about the 'shape and form' and one could equally abstain from culinary pleasures and keep a good 'physical' form. It all depends what makes one absolutely happy without feeling guilty about indulgence or abstinence. <br>

<p><b>Artist's Thoughts</b><br>
This artwork portrays the image of a
homeless child. The balloon in his hand
signifies the child's heart, filled with
treasures of dreams, his future being
reflected in the balloons he releases - of
course, a sad provocation as his dreams
remain still unfulfilled. He conveys a
message through the strings of his
balloons. He believes whatever we let go
off, will come back to us many times over.
So, he intends to watch what he lets go
off, waiting for their return and fulfillment
of his dreams</td></tr></table>

<br><br>
In the same way, Ravindra Babu approaches the physical environment around him and the growing urbanization with this idea of 'happiness' in mind. One could be absolutely against 'industrial progress' and be happy in his natural surroundings without even once touching artificial food or clothes. One could equally be pro-industry and hate whatever natural or only consider nature as touristic destinations. But there is always a middle path that shows sustainable growth and progress where factories and nature co-habit in harmony without thwarting their respective positions. Ravindra Babu seems to take the middle path in most of his paintings, while hinting at the possibilities of human life happily spent, spiritually elevated and philosophically experienced in an environment where the industrialization and nature stand in absolute harmony. But the question before the viewer is, how is such a middle path possible in our post-capitalist economic environment where industries work hand in hand with information technology and profit orientation becomes all the more concentrated in certain pockets, and spiritual salvation is considered as packaged tourism?<br>

<p><b>Artist's Thoughts</b><br>This art piece is a contemplation arising from
dream experiences often taking highly exaggerated and
bizarre forms-- such as this picture of a young girl with
jumbled up buildings. My dreams convey important
messages during sleep, create opportunities to better
understand my motives and actions. It emphasizes much
on values of our emotions and irrational inspiration. It is
reflective of my memories. Dreams connected to buildings signify new
possibilities in the future.</td></tr></table>

<br>
This is where Ravindra Babu's biographical details come into play; why, as an artist, Ravindra Babu is so concerned about the dichotomy of progress as seen in industrial development and proliferation, and a nostalgic past based in agricultural economics. Born in a small village in Andhra Pradesh, Ravindra Babu was brought up in an agrarian economy. He was surrounded by agricultural fields, mango groves and immense immaculate nature. As a young boy his life values were set against this backdrop of rural economics. A person who grows up and lives permanently there in a rural background would find anything urban as a way to and way of progress. He/she does not mind a new road coming into the village. He would not mind the plough is replaced by a tractor. He would not even critique a new building for school or hospital is built after cutting down a grove. He would not think much about a factory coming at the fringes of the village and the village playground slowly turning into a dump yard. He would always think that anything that is changing the face of the village is nothing but 'progress' therefore good for the society. This uncriticality is 'natural' to a person who does not have any other realities to compare with. The imagined reality of progress as facilitated by urbanization is the only alternative that a rural person could imagine provided he is not aware of the damages that it could cause in the long run.<br>
<br>

<table bgcolor="#ccc" cellpadding="10" align="right"><tr><td width="4">&nbsp; </td><td bgcolor="#999"><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/VRBabu/images/530.jpg"><br><greytext># 530, Reminiscence, Acrylic on canvas, 60 x 60 inches, 2009</greytext></center></td></tr></table>

Ravindra Babu, fortunately is a person who is educated in urban locations. He had his Bachelors in Fine Arts from Vishakhapatnam and Masters in Painting from the Jamia Millia Islamia at New Delhi. Hence, his frame of reference is different from that of a person who is destined to live in a 'changing' village. The comparison of industrial progress with the depletion of agrarian economy happens in two different ways in the artist. First of all, the artist looks at a 'lived' agrarian past which he deems as sylvan therefore desirable and nostalgic. Secondly, his 'living' urban realities put him in the dilemma of being an absolute critic of the industrial revolution happening in his back home realities. On the one hand he wants to realize the 'lived' past in the living present and on the other hand he establishes a creative link of comparison between the two taking a very objective stance. One should be lenient enough to think that the artist opts for the latter because he realizes that it is not always possible for someone to live in a sylvan backdrop yet one could take positive steps towards establishing a sustainable link between the past and the present.<br>
<br>

Even if there is a tinge of anxiety and fear seen on the faces of the protagonists in Ravindra Babu's paintings, he does not forget to put a sense of humour glimmering in their eyes. They stand in front of the large industrial establishments and most of them look like abandoned by the mainstream discourse of political, economic or cultural life. But Ravindra Babu in his works, insists that without these abandoned or deprived or left out people, no progress or any discourse on contemporary politics or economics is possible. As there are a lot of pictorial references in his works, he often prefers to hold the faces of the people close to the angle of perception. They are in tight close up when they are not set against a backdrop of urban indicators. Examples could be sought in the works titled 'Floating Dreams,' 'N Akin to Pain', 'The Child Behind', 'The Distance' and so on. These tight close up of children and people are like mirrors that reflect the surrounding realities and with these reflections on them, they assert their rightful places and their right to be included in the mainstream discourses of life. In 'Floating Dreams' a girl child's face is juxtaposed with high rising buildings in a metropolis (reminding the viewers of Manhattan skyline or Marine Drive in Mumbai). One could see, even if she is not a part of any of those buildings she very elegantly and diligently pursues her right to be there by making her face a mirror for them to get reflected.<br><br>

In most of the paintings done during 2010 and 2011, one could see Ravindra Babu experimenting with two modes of execution; one he creates the vast spaces illuminated by ethereal lights that divide the foreground and middle ground as two different experiential realities. And two he establishes identities for unidentified people. In the former set of works, Ravindra Babu deliberately uses the black, white and grey tones only to be highlighted by the sudden appearances of red or red as a sort of flattened background. While in the latter works, he deliberately uses red, grey and black as prominent hues so that the identities of the people could be presented as if they were pictures culled from different albums of life itself. Their eyes are optimistic even in their sheer deprivation. <strong>Unlike so many painters who create painterly representations of urban spaces through comparison of haves and have nots, of rich and poor, Ravindra Babu does not involve in the sympathy game by portraying these young people as sufferers. They are more like survivors in a system that is equally suppressing and facilitating.</strong><br>
<br>

One may think whether Ravindra Babu, by taking a middle path, is playing a safe game with the existing socio-economic and political realities. But I would say that it is one way of showing maturity in one's creative process. Ravindra Babu had been very critical of the systems once when he used to do his self portrait in the line of Michel Angelo's 'Slave'. He used to think that he was a victim of the systems that he was living in then. He had portrayed several children, young and old people as suffers but now he has matured enough to come out of that self sympathy and he is bold enough to portray people as happy people who could and would survive difficult situations created by ideological establishments. But could that sense of rebellion is dead and gone in the artist? I see the possibility of Ravindra Babu circumventing that rebellious spirit in a very interesting way and subtly bringing it back in a totally different fashion in his works. For example, he inverts the famous observation of Mahatma Gandhi that one day the villages would surround the cities, and paints villages as if they are being surrounded by the cities in a systematic process. He does not call it progress or degeneration. He converts the living realities into metaphors that demand immediate action from those people who see it. What could be that action is to be discussed in a larger context.<br>
<br>

Let's take the example of the painting titled 'The Distance'; a boy is seen crouching and watching a flight taking off from the airport. Between the sky where the flight is and the ground where the boy is there is a space that looks like a designer city spread across the canvas. The minimal, suggestive and graphic representation of the city that divides the two planes into 'up' and 'down' is an interesting metaphor that Ravindra Babu uses in many of his recent paintings. Here the up and down are two social layers; in the upper layer people could fly and at the lower/down level people are grounded. Here the boy who looks at the flight that is roaring above his head is not at all frightened by the presence of the huge aircraft (metaphorically, a symbol of progress and growing urbanization). In fact he is so accustomed to these flights that he looks a bit amused by the regularity of the take offs and landings of flights. This picture that shows the socio-economic disparity in our society is not representative of the urban rural divide but the divisions that are seen but casually harmonized within the developed sites of contemporary society.

<p><b>Artist's Thoughts</b><br>In my opinion villages are treasure
holders of ancient civilization even
today. A civilization bears a heritage
of beliefs, customs and knowledge
slowly accumulated in the course of
centuries, elements difficult at times
to justify by logic, but justifying
themselves as paths when they lead
somewhere, - opening up in man,
his inner distance - the distance that
arises from transition of antiquity to
modernity. A child feels a similar
transition watching an airplane
flying over his village... viewing
with astonishment, the mighty
distance.</td></tr></table>

The question, is there any possibility of making a true democratic society where everyone stands equal in rights and opportunities, and where everyone gets to drink clean water to drink and fresh air to breath, is repeatedly addressed in the works of Ravindra Babu. In this sense he is an environmentalist and is concerned about the possible future wars on water resources. It is cited that the future wars will be fought not on crude oil but on clean drinking water. The water resources are fast depleting from the face of the earth. The existing water situation is further worsened by the factory emissions. The erstwhile forests are being cut down for making space for residential spaces. While we are becoming more and more aware of the need for environmental protection, we mindlessly harm the remaining environmental balance through deforestation. Ravindra Babu while repeatedly bringing this issue, demands, from his artistic rights, actions for environmental protection and protection of water resources not only by the government agencies but also by the corporate houses that majorly support the industrial establishments. The artist considers this as a contemporary responsibility not only of the individuals but also of the society as a whole. Though the fundamental changes in a society could be brought in by proactive nature of individuals, he affirms that the societies and organizations in general should take added interest in these vital matters. One should see that he indirectly demands responsibility of the corporate and high net worth individual involved in these corporations who in fact while work towards a profit oriented economy also spend a part of their profit for social responsibility. This social responsibility interestingly, includes buying of works of art. If these corporate houses are supporting art and artists through patronage and support, it is Ravindra Babu's clarion call to them that it is high time that they involve themselves in environmental protection and the conservation of water resources.<br>

<br><br>
Ravindra Babu's concerns and anxieties for environmental protection becomes quite evident and one could make out that it is not just a fancy of the artist, when we see his series of paintings and a major installation in the year 2010. In an installation, which was at once site specific, process based and interactive, titled 'Disturbed Landscapes', Ravindra Babu created a huge traditional iron box (which is generally used for ironing clothes, using coal or burnt coconut shell as heat source) as an emblem of resistance against the growing industrial houses along the city-village fringes. He filled it with the soil collected from the former agricultural lands of his village. Then he grew paddy in it and the process took several days, inviting people to involve in the process. This interactive work was something that the artist pushed forward to the face of a non-art buying community so that they themselves could understand the meaning of 'progress' within the confined contexts that they lived. This was a critique strong enough but not harsh. The playfulness of the work brought back memories of the past, reality of the present and the possible projects for sustainable growth of rural and urban economy harmoniously. Perhaps no other medium could convey effectively what art could convey to the public even if the messages are shouted out through loudspeakers.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
'Loudspeakers' is another favourite subject that Ravindra Babu has always been interested in. According to me loudspeaker appears in his paintings not just as a symbol of loud sound but as emblematic to the phony nature of our contemporary society. In one of his large scale installations titled 'Aspiring Reconciliation', Ravindra Babu brings in a group of loudspeakers and places a human figure right in the middle of it. The enclosure made out of the loudspeakers creates a world of its own where human beings are caught in their utter desperations. In our world, offers and promises are bandied out by several agencies that govern the human bodies and minds and the human beings are supposed to listen to these deafening sounds without understanding much of the meanings they try to convey.<br>
<br>

On the one hand, there is a literal symbolism in this work and on the other hand, the artist wants to hint at the sound pollution as he is concerned about the environmental issues. The emblematic loudspeakers appear not only in his sculptural installations but also in his paintings. In one of the recent paintings titled 'Sphery Chime', he brings in an image of a young boy squatting in the foreground with his back turned towards the viewers and looking at the loudspeakers kept along the landscape in front of him. Interestingly, the factories that once used to fill in the horizon line of his paintings are now replaced by the communication towers that hold the huge antennas and radars used by the cable television network and mobile communication devices. The contrast and comparison between the loudspeakers and the communication towers is quite interesting because even if the loudspeakers are not outdated, with the arrival of new communication facilities they have rendered obsolete at least in the urban centres. The loudspeakers in a way play a role of nostalgia for the artist. He hints at the changing environmental realities caused by the changing mode of communications.<br>

The latest body of works (2012), mostly paintings done in acrylic and oil on canvas, features changing urban scapes. Mostly they are liminal spaces that we often find between the urban and rural areas. They are not suburbs in the literal sense, yet they are the beginning of the rural areas or the ending of the urban centres. It is in these unarticulated liminal spaces that we often see the dangerous installations by the government and corporate agencies. They are far enough to be safe for the urban dwellers and close enough to be dangerous for the rural people. Though there is not a stark division between the urban and rural areas in India thanks to the proliferation of modern communication facilities and cable television networks, these liminal spaces are occupied by those young people who are precarious in their existence and ambiguous in asserting their identities. Even if they are not the surrogate presences of the artist himself, Ravindra Babu empathizes with most of them. One of the boys is seen perched on the electric wires while another one is seen on an emission pipe of a factory. Both place themselves at the edge of life, and open themselves to possible dangers but still dare to do so as if they were ready to accept the changing realities but still understand the precariousness of their own positioning. This precariousness has always been a defining feature of Ravindra Babu's paintings and it is important to understand that through this unique social positioning they become a sort of critics of what is going on around them. They mind their own business but at the same time are aware of what is happening around them.<br>
<br>

Like in some of the paintings done during 2010 and 2011, in most of the paintings in the latest series, Ravindra Babu creates the foreground, middle ground and background concept so that he could place his figures without much conflict within the pictorial frame and at the same time to be clear about his intentions and the interpretative possibilities of such images. <strong>Ravindra Babu, a socially concerned artist with a vision to fulfil in the coming years and who has been working towards it during the last five years, with consistency and diligence to bring back the issues pertaining to environmental protection and water conservation in his works of art irrespective of the mediums.</strong> As I mentioned before, Ravindra Babu is an artist who is aware of the fact that the future wars will be based on the scarcity of water. Hence, his forthcoming project is on water conservation where he would be creating a site specific well, a commemorative symbol of the water sources from the yester years. <br>
<br>

Social commitment and aesthetic distancing are the two important things that an artist often finds difficult to balance in his or her creative career. At times, the social commitment overtakes the artist and the works are reduced to sloganeering. And at times aesthetic sophistication mars the real issues and turns the works of art into decorative objects. Luckily, in the case of Ravindra Babu Veguri this does not happen in that way. <strong>He is an artist who has earned the kind of experience to balance his social commitment with aesthetic sophistication.</strong> While he sticks to painterly modes, and experiments with the pictorial executions, he takes all efforts to contain his concerns for the life philosophies that guide him in life as well as art. <strong>In one of the recent essays written on Sudhir Patwardhan, noted historian R Sivakumar observed that the aesthetic distancing is a major achievement that one artist could achieve without compromising the social commitments that the artist once had or still has. Artistic maturity is what defines this process. Ravindra Babu Veguri at this young age itself has achieved it and it is a commendable achievement in itself.

<p><b>Artist's Thoughts</b><br>This is a conceptual artpiece, wherein I
portray the behaviour of humans reflecting
the political race in our society. In this
distorted race, our leaders compete with one
another for their unlimited desires, unaware
of possible consequences leading to
imminent devastation of the future of the
nation. 'Abiding in the midst of ignorance
thinking themselves wise and learned, fools
go aimlessly hither and thither like blind led
by the blind, where both shall fall into the
ditch', is the actual idea of "Blind Man Race"
painting. Social commentary is neither the
aim nor the drive of art, but I am just
expressing my opinion on the nature of the
present society - each following someone's
lead which I have symbolically portrayed
with human figures on canvas. I look forward
to the youth to put an end to this blind race.
