 <b>A Voyage in to Hallucination</b>

<br>

   <p><i> by Dr Shailendra K Kushwaha</i>
 
<br><br>
Veguri Ravindra Babu was born in 1983 in a tiny village of Andhra Pradesh with a modest upbringing where sustainability to adverse human conditioning always exerts constrain for day to day survival. Ravindra has shown a great inclination at early age of eight towards visual manipulations, done in the form of doodling and his innate urge to develop a sense of skill for making na√Øve configurations on different textured surfaces of walls and paper. During his school days at St Arnold High School, a catholic institution, he was given an opportunity to explore his hidden potentials as a child who spontaneously explores the subconscious strata of mind in order to negotiate his playfulness with a vivid range of imageries. Once he was encouraged by his teachers to pursue his carreer in visual arts, more precisely in to painting then he never looked back and finally affiliated with Fine Arts College at Vishakhapatnam where he got exposed to various art trends, mediums and a contemporary approach to the multiplicity of visual culture thriving around in more trans- regional context. Slowly Ravindra imbibed a visual vocabulary with a comfortable understanding of image construct with a tendency to <b>evolve a controlled configuration with a deep sense of looking back to his immediate past</b>, very personal and sharing his subjectivity with a rational interpretative intervention. His dilemma, agony, varied human values and an unprecedented ache for haunted, ghost like deceptive world of his inner soul, was his immediate concern to transmute his versatility in to an illusionary world of two - dimensionality on a textured surface with mediums of his preference.

<p><b>Artist's Thoughts</b><br>
This artpiece is a reflection of the customs and traditions of Buddhist child monks, a picture that inspired me while travelling to the great stupa of Buddha located near my village, Amravati. The
lifestyle of these children in this modern age touched my soul. Their deep devotion to Lord Buddha melts
the hearts of people!</td></tr></table>

Ravindra is venturing in to  graphic quality along with a textual referential mode of expression therefore his paintings can not be perceived superficially rather <b>each work is a testimony of his highly personalized discourse in narrative context</b>. He also explored the visual exhilaration of his skills and reflected his affection to the grass root reality of his own cultural affiliation. His human figures are never loosening their contours, never melting away in to the space; they are restricted with more corporeal and have a tendency for the vivacity. The grotesque element was never brought to the extent of indefinable relationship. One can feel the presence of the painter's objective legitimacy to the human conditioning when detached from the innate ambiance. When he came out of his academic learning from the institution, he became more inexhaustible in his assimilation process and depicted freely his distress, unstated aspiration and his personal mundane world of imageries distressing him in his subliminal state of mind.

<p><b>Artist's Thoughts</b><br>
This particular series of artworks "Scared Spirits" portray past regression of my
thoughts that stripped me of the power to succeed. Though I had the freedom to express, I was in a
dilemma to step forward. Intrinsic fear made me restless. I resolutely took control of my mind and
tried to function through the perspective of my inner self. Reminiscences, figurative artworks
expressing intense feelings and childhood experiences in the village are laid bare in these artworks.</td></tr></table>

He is not loosing the contemporariness of his time which emerges larger than life size in his works like, "Dump the Uncharismatic FM", "Corneille Pecking", "Karma, Kartha, Kriya", series on "Scared Spirits", "Road Not Taken", "Adam's Apple" and recently painted canvases with "Untitled" as captions, <b>reflecting his metaphorical subjectivity with a subdued tint of spirituality derived from mundane world of human experience</b>. Ravindra's hallucination is not mesmerized, on contrary it questions the inner self and with tremendous conviction as he narrates his visual parlance. As he reveals during his informal discourse regarding his work, "Dump the Uncharismatic FM", "<i>My area of thought is largely focusing on contemporary issues, which I tried to portray in my painting". This painting reflects my resentment towards the stagnant, un- innovative FM radio...</i>
<br>
<br>

The <b>psychedelic dips and surges of space in these paintings</b>, where there are flat surfaces of hues are placed on ground level and voyeuristic close-ups of goings-on high up in the sky as used for the portrayals of the cluster of diagrammatic symbols sandwiched between verdant stretch, as well as the archetypal motifs with decorative non-conventional settings bubbles with vegetal eruptions, transgressing  conspicuous creatures, or frank serene interplay of bodily gesticulation, are all visionary trajectories of a sage in a land of worldly pain and passion.

He uses loud - speakers and microphones prominently and flock of crows on e-wire with very transparent visual effect with a limited colour palette, dominated by Indian red against black and white background or a pattern making approach devoid of stereotyped representations is carefully augmented. Human figures are reflecting a participative aura in the vast panoramic stretched spaces with wizard expressions fused with a marooned sense of pathos. <b>His faces are very expressive and vibrating with an undercurrent of tranquility</b> which further accelerates towards a stage of sublime. Interrelationship between different domains is echoing a element of composed impulsiveness which is highly personalized encounter of visual reality around him. Portraying a sense of order in more cosmological deviation is worth pondering in Ravindra"s work.
<br>
<br>

His intense urge to be prolific is also leading towards a dichotomy of text and image. His canvases are far stretched to cope up a void space, used as a backdrop where main protagonist is conveying a monologue with a deep sense of remorse and onlookers glance can not confine in to seclusion of hidden visual paradigm which is executed skillfully. His figural manifestation is weighed down with his schematic understanding of linearity with a balanced attribution, negating the ephemeral aspect of materialistic world where man is trapped to negotiate his own space under a magnitude of man made persuasion, conflicting sustainability of human survival.

<p><b>Artist's Thoughts</b><br>
This painting signifies life's complications and
hardships - they reflect on the child's
innocence.This artpiece reflects an
entangled web / network of life's mishaps and
threads - it signifies how we weave our own
obstacles and get entangled in situations
leading to a deceptive life. The meaning is,
basically, that lies beget more lies, and that
masking lies with more lies, creates an evermore-
complex arrangement of falsehoods.
Such a situation comes when we
and become a victim of our own acts.</td></tr></table>

<b>Ravindra - a thinker artist offers a much needed addition to the existing body of Indian Contemporary art, with a completely fresh and novel perspective.</b> The content in his paintings continue to play on the viewers' mind for longer than one can imagine and his international appeal <b>makes him set to carry the mantle of Indian Contemporary Art to the rest of the world</b>. It is not long before he will be regarded in the Indian and International art scene as a contemporary master.
