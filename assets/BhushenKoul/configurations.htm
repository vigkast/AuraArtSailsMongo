     <td><h1>Configurations of experiences</h1><p align="justify">
Bhushen Koul is not new to national scene. Recipient of fifteen awards including ‘Man-Patra‘ from his alma mater and Lalit Kala Akademi Award, and having displayed his works in more than thirty exhibitions, state, national and international exhibition, he undoubtedly has established his credentials. One of the most constant painters from Kashmir, Bhushen comes from a family with considerable literary and artistic accomplishments. He is a master degree holder from Baroda University.<br><br>

Bhushen Koul’s  paintings,  in their essence reflect his interaction with the pre-symbolic rendered into  substantive scheme. They are broadly speaking, configurations of experiences, both lived and dwelt upon, in which the artist transforms abstract into comprehensible in a pictorial semantics that, besides building the desired aesthetic import, amply conveys the message. If his works are sometimes mistaken as falling in something of the surrealistic genre, it is more due to the cause than the effect. Bhushan’s idiom is more epithetic than symbolic. The clarity of approach is as vivid as deftness in treatment. His images, though appearing to have been drawn from some dream world, are not remote. Human faces, looking dazed as if under the burden of their own being, seem to be the echo of our own selves. In their recurring presence they appear to be pre-facing; yet they by   themselves do not make high points and not let disturb or dominate the overall scheme. That should underline Bhushen’s understanding of proportions and restraint. There are profuse references to the natural world made with matching pictorial propriety. Apart from being ancillaries to the intended annotation, such references also act as structuring devices. Bhushen is precise- almost mathematical about arrangement and positioning of contributive elements in overall design, For Bhushen there can’t be two solutions to a problem. Every element is deliberate and their interplay together orchestrated.<br><br>
Bhushen is particularly distinctive in his colours, which are very much his own and refer very little to any tried palette. Choice from the myriad is dictated by the demands of the experience being painted. Colours are soulful, sumptuous without being sentimental. However, what makes him particularly different is the luminosity he imparts to his colours. He has evolved for himself a method of irradiation which pervades his canvasses. Radiance achieved to closely woven tonal gradation has the impact of what a critic sometimes back aptly remarked “pensive wonderment “. Bhushen paints with swift, illusive touches, a kind of braura brush work which also helps promote texture and vivacity. A spontaneous inter-flow of glowing colours paraphrased by gentle raps of light bring into play the potential of line and accentuate planes.
<br><br>

“Experience endured and enlivened – that is my art", says Bhushen. “Experience in terms of both triggered off feelings and ensuing thought processes being abstract in their nature, my creative endeavour is concerned with constructing a recognizable visual parallel to distinct features of what I must essay. It is a process that determines the pictorial vocabulary I must use, and the treatment I must employ so as to make my effort more fervid. It keeps on coming at times in bits, at times all of it together, like I was weaving a plot of a short story. I am social and communicative and believe imminent purpose of art is to evoke empathy-self included." Bhushen Koul says that there is a writer somewhere in him, and there sure is.<br>

      <p align="justify">Having had the traumatic experience back in the valley --- 
        he lost his house, studio, library, and workshop, it is only expected 
        same should find expression in his works, this time. It has. Loosing of 
        workshop has affected Bhushen equally for he was never single minded --- 
        a rare combination—he has interests in mechanical innovations jewellery 
        of aesthetic value design and execution of functional objects. “These 
        creations, I do not know why I do it, but when I see designs practically 
        developing stage after stage into a full solid, just in front of my eyes---my 
        God ! I DID THIS? A feeling of self embellishment emerges within.” By 
        seeing these creations one clearly understands the immense pleasure Bhushen 
        must be getting. </p></td><td width="20">&nbsp; </td><td width="200"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/BhushenKoul/images/sk030.jpg" ><br><br><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/BhushenKoul/images/sk26.jpg"></td>
