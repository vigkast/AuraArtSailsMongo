Transformation in the field of visual art, whatever it takes shape, either possess two dimensional existence or three dimensional physicity in the form of visual record could be termed as self image mirror of an artist. But the transformation has to be right, as well as, in full in itself, which requires a lot of creative experience and skill, wider perspective, wider observation and above all eye cube of individual. Undoubtedly, the oeuvres by Bhushen Koul possess these qualities
<br><br>Mr. Bhushen Koul is a master artist of the country, well known for projecting his visualizations so wonderfully within the frame of two dimensional art, i.e. painting.
<br>Transformation in his composition encompasses all aspects of his self assured world in which he has lived through.
<br>It needs to be mentioned that Mr. Bhushen blessed the state with tremendous contributions in the realm of art. So the J & K State expresses its gratitude to his pioneering endeavours to bring our State on the National and International scene
<br><br>The first professional and qualified artist from Baroda who joined The Institute of Music and Fine Arts Srinagar served as a key which unravelled the ‘mysteries of creativity’ in a large number of inspiring artists. He has been instrumental in affiliating the state run hobby art institute to their respective universities. 
<br><br>While concluding his merit of ‘work of art’ , it may be mentioned countless on lookers have gone through his offbeat and magnificent presentations. His works where ever displayed evoked critical appreciation. And his presentation has forced people to think over theme and subject. Whatever he has recorded in his format of pictorial set up appears as rational statements comprising of object – subject mutation. His startling yet subtle coloured commentary of folk reveal musical blending like “ SANTOOR “ suffused with poetic gravity.
<br><br>His compositions are as simple as he is himself “my earlier visual statements were of journalistic flavour immediately after my exodus from the valley“, are remarks of the artist regarding his works. Although his work has gone under a major change, he never left his consistency and convictions. During last two decades his thought has become purer and crystallised aesthetically,  this process he calls “empathy “.
