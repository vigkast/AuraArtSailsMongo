Without preplanning, I set out with a 2b pencil which this most sensitive of papers lured to its surface. Thus began this set of drawings extending over six months becoming a homage to the purest of all arts - music. It became an alap in itself, a kind of voyage of discovery." <br />

"Krishen Khanna is famous for his expressionist paintings tinged with existential angst.  He has represented the common working class people and has given them iconic status in his work.  Here he responds to the social situation of human beings who are completely tied up to their seats, gagged and tortured and asked for talking out their opinion.  The oppressive nature of our contemporary times is brought efficiently in this painting.."<br />

"Satish Gujral has painted a series of dancers and musicians in his typical style.  Through a special building up of surface texture, in this work one could see a wandering minstrel performing in a deserted land at night, tapping happily on the drums.  And he invokes the image of a horse, which is symbolic of divine power through his music.  The abstracted image of horse is a defining feature of this painting."</p></div>

"In this painting Satish Gujral continues with his fascination for lonely travelers who seek divine visions.  Though the man seen here is riding a pair of rams therefore imparting an idea of him being a shepherd, his accidental encounter with a divine fire in a cave is the pivotal theme in this painting.  This encounter could be read out as the spiritual revelations of an ordinary man."</p>

"This miniature by Manjit Bawa showcases his characteristic bright colours. The flat yellow background brings out the contours of the luminescent figure of Krishna. The painting amalgamates elements of two series: 'figure with a bird' and Krishna-Ranjha both of which derive from a rich textual and popular tradition and thereby resonating with painterly polyphony."<strong> - Dr Seema Bawa</strong> </p></div>

"That Manjit Bawa had consummate control over line is clear from this drawing of the flute playing Ranjha as Krishna. This study showcases his stylistic development in terms of lines and tonalities within the figure.

"A very early work of Manjit Bawa's artistic career when he concentrated on landscapes using water colour and oil. His exploration of colour, line and form in the journey towards discovering his aesthetic grammar is aptly demonstrated in this painting of 'birds in flight' done during one of his many early travels in India. One can see the pristine  watery background of  Bharatpur  in  morning  light."<strong> - Dr Seema Bawa</strong></p>

"Paramjit Singh's mastery in creating vertical ascendancy of forests and horizontal expansion of the shrubs and grassy land becomes all the more pronounced in this painting. The skilful use of oil painting and the predominance use of bluish green give the painting a complete feel of peace and harmony. The horizontal dynamics of the painting leads the viewer to see it as an expanse that merges with the suggestion of serene blue sky. But at the meeting point one sees a patch of black that the artist adds as a balance of pleasure that intimates the viewer of life and its mortal ends. The yellow ochre at the foreground at once connotes earth and its sparkler like happiness in having such greenery still intact."</p></div>

They mark places as well as mental spaces. In this marking, he also flags out the losses that we have incurred in due course of time due to deforestation. In this work, the ascending greenery that touches upon the skyline at the top of an illusionary hill enthrals the viewer while the artist focuses on the greys that gnaw at the green from the foreground of the painting.

"Like a Nehruvian, Yousuf Ali also believed in the progressive nature of the society and also he witnessed how urban spaces were being built.  Though he was not too much for urbanization what attracted him to the urban sites was the kind of energy invested by the laborers in building structures.

"This painting belongs to the peak phase of Yousuf Ali's career.  He was intensely interested in music and had taken a great interest in depicting musical sessions.  In a cubistically inclined style the artist has painted so many musical themes.  Yousuf Ali is not a cubist in strictest sense though he deconstructs the contours to create a symphony of planes and colors."<br />

There is an erotically charged atmosphere lingering around the figures though they are not in a conjugal position.  This energy and synergy between two people are brought in by the deconstruction of forms as well as the pictorial surface."

"The formative years of Yousuf Ali were spent in making so many experimental works.  Western Modernism was the widely acclaimed model that had been pursued by many artists of 1960s and 70s.  Here a young Yousuf Ali paints a boat in an Impressionistic style.  The oil paint strokes on board are thick and the effect of light on the central object is highlighted by the nature of impasto applied by the artist."<br />

The atmosphere is serene and the sky is clear, and farmer who is not in the picture has gone home leaving the bullocks to eat their hay.

"Sidharth has interpreted the months of Indian calendar in hallmark style.  In this painting he celebrates the month of Asaad 
(July-August) where according to Indian rituals the couples are not expected to stay together.  Hence it is the month of romantic thoughts and is filled with longing of separated lovers.  One could see the iconic tree is filled with birds that take messages to lovers while the old people continue with their works."</p></div>

"Sidharth is a great story teller.  Most of his paintings have this narrative quality in them.  In this painting, he once again goes back to his childhood where he clearly sees his mother taking care of the plants and father reading Guru Granth Sahib.

<br /><br />
"This is a very unusual painting by Sidharth.  Though he avoids sequential narratives in his paintings, in this work titled Ganga he brings out a complete narrative in which the river Ganges plays the central part.  The occasion is of Durga immersion.  While the city life goes on as usual at one bank, on the other there is a flood of devotees.  A surreal element is incorporated as a surprise as the viewer witnesses a woman catching a fish with an invisible thread coming out of her clothes."</div><br />

"Night Field is a work done by me as an attempt to move away from the kind of work which I was doing until then.  With a conscious decision to work with a limited pallet.  It also has a reference to the story of the Shepherd boy calling out for help even while there was no imminent threat from the tiger and eventually no one coming to save him when the beast really turns up.  The intention was to create a room with the story as a background.  Looking back, I also see it as a work which prompted many of those works which I ended up doing later." - <strong>Artist's note</strong><br />

"Viren Tanwar is a contemporary miniaturist.  He draws his themes and inspirations from the Pahari and Kangra miniature traditions.  In the two small paintings he depicts how the music of Krishna attracts young women.  In the left frame, a young woman is seen in her swing at her courtyard.  Her youthfulness is highlighted by the presence of birds in the frame.  In the right frame she is seen to have left her home for the music of her lover."

"Viren Tanwar's interest for the Krishna lore once again comes into play in this painting.  Here, Krishna is seen at the left side of the painting but interestingly he is portrayed as a levitating figure.  It suggests that the divine flute player is present everywhere.  On the foreground we see Radha, the beloved of Krishna, sitting and wistfully looking at Krishna.  It is a moment of engagement between  the  individual  and  universal  souls."

</span><br /><br /><br />
In this work, Viren Tanwar moves slightly away from his preoccupation with miniature style.  However while retaining the miniature feel of the painting he makes the protagonists look more contemporary.  Though archetypal in their presence, the loving couple in the painting is seen in their primal erotic energies and in a deep embrace.  The imminence of their union is suggested by the greenish hue pervading the painting."</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

It gives a nostalgic feeling about Kashmir waterscapes and landscapes where life goes on smoothly in harmony with nature.  The man in the boat seems to be absolutely in tune with his surroundings and it is a scene of tranquility and meditation." </div><br />

"What I seek in my artistic expressions is silent activity not easily discernible to the eye but can be experienced in contemplation. In such moments of creativity my whole being is transformed into a plant that grows every minute by remaining firmly rooted to the soil. This feel of eternity and silent activity gives wings to my imagination. And that inspires me to tune the rhythmic visual voice and its subtle nuances in consonance with my heartbeat. My paintings reflect on such playful and prayerful moments that I experience through my dialogue with the manifest and the unmanifest in Nature.

"Ruby Jagrut is an interesting painter with an eye for abstraction. She does not use the traditional abstract art techniques to develop her pictorial surfaces. Instead, by using natural dyes, like a classical artist, she creates scenes from life, which are treated in a very personalized style. While she desists from narration, she gives enough clues for the viewer to understand the painting.

"In this beautiful painting, a girl is seen conversing with a bird that has just come and perched on the branches of a tree filled with flowers.  The background shows a landscape bathed in yellow sunlight.  It is springtime.  Bird imagery in art suggests time and message.  The painting connotes that the girl is in conversation with time and at the same time she sends a secret message to her beloved."<br />

"Umakant Kanade's sharp graphic quality makes this work worth pondering.  As in his other paintings, here too he looks at a sylvan landscape and depicts it in a very sensual way.  Though the monochromatic feel is the tone of the painting, the colorful birds that flit in make all the difference. They impart a quality of surrealism to the otherwise realistic painting."

"Umakant Kanade's works have sharp graphic quality.  Though his medium is acrylic on canvas, he gives fine detailing through minute brush works.  He uses his palette minimally but the sudden introduction of colors makes the works vibrate with energy.  In this painting, he presents an elevated view of nature in monochromes.  Sudden appearance of two colorful birds makes the work more appealing."

"This work of Ramesh Thorat belongs to the school of neo Tantric abstraction.  The neo-tantric artists generally make the figures palpable blocking the possibilities of narration.

"Master photographer, printmaker and great chronicler of the tribal and folks traditions of India, Jyoti Bhatt has always shown his proficiency to move between mediums. His ability to adopt new mediums makes this work more fascinating. In this inkjet print on archival paper, he photographs a pair of masks as if they were the impressions of a face just wiped off on to handkerchief. He plays up the ambiguity of transferring identities to the mediums of human engagement while keeping the religious and sacramental connotations of facial impressions on shrouds and holy clothes. This simple work moves between the religious and the secular, and the mundane and divine." <br />

'Silent Shloka' emerged out of this intensely spiritual experience, which in a way differentiates from religion. This series is not just about the possibilities of the form, but also about the expression of peace experienced through the form that is associative with faith and the meditative energy of God." - <strong>Artist's note</strong></div>

Many medieval writings, scriptures and horoscopes passed on to me from my family adorn my studio. Whenever I see ancient inscriptions and scriptures, they invoke a strange sense of excitement within me.  Memories of my maternal grandfather writing with pen dipped in ink, though vague, have remained with me firmly.  This sculptural installation is the result of the formation of my own imagery of such memories.  The calligraphy has emanated from the medieval writings and scriptures.

    <div align="justify"> It is my fervent belief that art is a derivative of the finer instincts of man. There is little doubt that man enters a different plane and realm of thinking when the brush meets the canvas or the chisel, the stone. This is surely the work of the Supreme Master whose art, I am convinced, is omnipresent in all of nature. It is this finer instinct of man that Aura Art has been in search of over the years since it was first set-up in 2006 and Aura Art Development Pvt Ltd subsequently incorporated in 2008. When I talk of finer instincts and the Divine touch, I cannot help but recall one of the finest artists I had the privilege of being very closely associated since 1983, S Yousuf Ali. To say the least, his genius was and will always continue to be a constant source of inspiration -- his works, a supreme joy to behold! His paintings, having a soul and a rare kind of beauty, are held in high esteem by all collectors as well as art critics.<br />
<br />

Ever since its inaugural prestigious show at the Nehru Centre in 2008, Aura Art's growth has been phenomenal. In a short period of six years, Aura Art has reached the stature of being accepted as one of India's unique and leading Art Company. The most significant reason for this dramatic growth has been the adoption of a corporate culture seldom seen in the art world. Corporate culture begins with professionalism and ends with the desire to assume leadership. If Aura Art has been professional in every aspect of its activities, it has been with the desire to be a trend-setter and lead the way in the art world.

<br />
<br />
Our specialised and professional services to the customer speak for themselves. We, at Aura Art, have always been keen to develop a class of buyers who love art enough to recognise them as precious assets. And assets always need to be carefully selected, sustained, protected and made to grow. We have therefore adopted invaluable service activities, by assisting collectors in identifying the artists and artworks to be collected, advising them in cataloguing, maintaining, preserving, packing, transporting, insuring and warehousing the works and if required, even to restore the same. <br />
<br />

As stated in our list of objectives, we are keen on giving maximum exposure to good art because we realise art generates sensitivity in the minds of people especially in a world that is smitten with chaos  and  complexities  of modern life. There  have  been quite a few occasions when top-of-the-line developers, hotels, corporate bodies and art festivals have invited Aura Art to participate in important inaugural events or to be the art partner. On some occasions, such invitations had the joint participation of reputed charitable institutions, giving us an additional sense of social responsibility. Thus far, more than 30 shows have been held in major art centres of the country.<br />
<br />

When Aura Art was invited by the luxury five star Hotel Shangri-La at Lower Parel, Mumbai, to provide an imposing wall mounted sculpture for its towering wall space in the lobby, it was a challenge of a different kind because we were required to undertake the entire assignment, including installation. Commissioning of the artist, approval of design and fabrication of integral parts resulted in a wall mounting comprising two pieces of a major sculpture in wood, with german silver foil covering, of the size of 25 ft by 15 ft and weighing over a ton each. The task of installing this unwieldy work of art had to be planned meticulously to the last detail even in terms of the engineering aspects of stress on bolts and gravity. It was a vertical installation and the job was rendered flawlessly. Executed well to time schedules, the job later invited a second installation in the same hotel!  In addition, Aura Art has been the sole art adviser for various leading corporate projects in the new Financial hub at BKC, including the leading South African Bank and a Stock Research and Investment House.<br />
<br />

In this Catalogue 2013 of the first edition of Aura Art Show, we at Aura Art have spared no efforts to ensure that we bring to you some of the finest work India has produced in the art scene. We have made an effort to balance this show with a wide choice to art lovers of both the worlds - the timeless creations of old masters along with a meaningful combination of the works of some of the later artists who want to show the world, both the beauty and paradoxes of today's life. Visual sense driven by a passion for excellence has been Aura Art's unique effort in all it shows. The show at Jehangir Art Gallery, while giving a panoramic view of the old and the new, will be rendered in a balanced manner that will be pleasant to the onlooker's eye.<br />
<br />

I must submit, this complex selection of works and catalogue presentation would not have been possible without the tireless efforts and professional inputs of the Company's Directors, Harmeet Singh Sethi and Rishiraj Sethi, and its Head of Design and Communications, Satish Pillai.<br />
<br />

Pablo Picasso very succinctly said, "The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls." When we look at the hurried, insensitive, cyclical, irrational and materialistic world around us, we realise the significance of what one of the world's greatest artists had to say about art. There is little doubt that art cleanses man's soul that has been tainted by base desires of today's life pattern. And if Aura Art is pursuing a great mission undauntedly, it is this:  To wash the soul and wait for the touch of the Supreme Master! <br />

<div align="justify">I doubt if there is any other country in the world like India with such a multi-geographic, multi-lingual, multi-cultural and multi-religious backdrop. This has not only determined the way people live their lives but has also influenced art forms in distinctively different ways. And now, what is even more interesting is that the cross-culture exposure brought about by the electronic media is contributing to the evolution of these art forms in two excitingly opposite directions.<br />
<br />

There are artists who, inspired by this cross-culture exposure, are attempting to intermingle concepts and styles to create something new; while there are others who stubbornly want to safeguard the origins of their art and go deeper back to their roots. I have met artists who openly lament the changing trends in what was the idyllic life of the villages they hailed from - and as they say, so close to their hearts not so long ago! Their passion now is to portray that life of typical customs, traditions and simple joy through their art. It is as though they would like to preserve and record the simplicity and beauty of village life they once perceived, for all succeeding generations. And then, there are others who fall in line with the changing trends and want to record this phase with a blend of the old and the new. There are still others who are so inspired by what they have never been exposed to before, that they go diagonally across to discover and portray the new state of their mind! I feel it will be long before this transition, backward, intermediary or forward, slows down. As long as this continues, Indian art will see some exciting phases of not only new development but also re-discovery.<br />
<br />

In my many tours to different parts of the country trying to unearth precious works of grandmasters and to identify new artists of calibre, the depth and diversity of talent has baffled me. It was fascinating to learn how distinctively different artists are and how their personal experiences tend to influence the images and forms they create. This is one of the significant reasons why Aura Art believes in procuring works directly from artists or the family members they have left behind the works with. It enables us to understand the artist and his works better, while at the same time, ensuring the authenticity of the work. <br />
<br />

This last one year of intensive search for artworks for the Aura Art Show 2013 has been an enriching experience. During that period, my passion for good works of art yielded some extremely precious collections. One of them was a rare set of museum quality artworks titled Raaga Lakeeeran Waali by Krishen Khanna -- a small accordion-fold book of a set of eighteen individual yet interconnected, exquisite pencil drawings on the theme of music. Also, an astounding bronze portrait of the greatest Sufi poet of all times - Jalaluddin Rumi, by the same artist. There were other invaluable discoveries too of both paintings and sculptures -- such as a man riding a pair of rams, acrylic on canvas by Satish Gujral; a magnificent landscape of the late 1960s by Manjit Bawa; two exquisite works by Paramjit Singh in his typical style of beautifully rendering vast grassy lands and forests with shrubs; and an imposing bull in a seated position, by Dhruva Mistry.<br />
<br />

When you succeed a little in your quest of the superlative, there is an insatiable passion that drives you to search for more. In 'Ganga', a masterly creation in mineral pigments and silver leaf, Sidharth's visual narrative is beyond what words can describe. His style makes him unique and his sensibility will take him to far greater heights.  <br />
<br />

S Yousuf Ali started working in the 1960s and continued to create outstanding paintings till the mid 1990s before passing away in 1997, at the age of 58. He held 11 solo exhibitions at the Taj Mahal hotel art gallery in Mumbai besides other exhibitions in India and abroad. Seldom did any painting remain unsold at these exhibitions. Such was the respect he commanded through the quality of his art that MF Husain in the presence of my father had asked S Yousuf Ali for his painting in exchange for two paintings created by the Master MF Husain. S Yousuf Ali's paintings are held with pride in prestigious art collections. His artworks combine a unique mastery of skill, composition and style along with a deep understanding of human anatomy. His works in the show include various manifestations of Allah, combining Arabic calligraphy with symbolic graphics -- an uncommon devotional tribute through art; another masterpiece where Yousuf's subtle, realistic depiction of a distant war scene, is dominated by a powerful close-up of a mahout's tool in the foreground -- a reminder of the unbelievable versatility of his hand; also an astounding canvas of a santoor player in those characteristic strokes and cuts Yousuf was known for -- conveying the passion he had for music during his lifetime. <br />
<br />

Umesh Varma who studied under artists like Somnath Hore and Dhanraj Bhagat was part of the group, 'The Six', formed in the end of the 1950s along with Manjit Bawa, sculptor Durga Prasad and three other artists. He gained recognition at the national exhibition of Lalit Kala Academy in 1964. In the same year he went to Japan for two years on a scholarship from Mombusho - the Japanese Ministry of Education and Culture. The visual images Umesh Varma  creates  on  the  canvas  are  purely     an imaginative and creative expression of the angst prevailing within him and are deeply connected with philosophy. He is an artist whose artworks ought to be widely displayed in museums. <br />
<br />

With his superlative execution of moments we see and experience in our daily lives, Tejinder Kanda, with a blunt blade, creates paintings on canvas that instill joy in the minds of the viewers. Shailesh Patel's drawings of human body parts with animals or machines like elements in juxtaposition with various other motifs or patterns helping create rhythm and symbolizing meaningful forms, make him an artist whose sensibility will be taken serious note of by historians. Out of hundreds of young artists I have come across in the past ten years, one artist amongst the few, who has stood out in terms of thought process, ideas, sensibility and execution is Veguri Ravindra Babu. His fine balancing act of portrayal of the strain caused by rapid urbanization on rural resources on the one side and the future benefit it may bring to village folk on the other, is remarkable. Veguri's series of installations highlighting the impact of industrialization on the five elements of nature (Panchtatva), his portrayal of hope amidst despair, to experience joy in simple things, his ability to convey his message using a minimal color palette, all this and more, make him well positioned to make his mark in future Contemporary history of Art.<br />
<br />

Constraints of brevity restrain me from talking loudly about my other jewels whose artworks I am proudly displaying in the Show.<br />
<br />

I would like to recall and reiterate that Aura Art Show 2013 has been conceived with a view to providing a prestigious platform to also new artists who have shown great potential and who with their persistent efforts will grow to become grand masters of the future. When that happens, Aura Art will have fulfilled one of its significant objectives.<br />
<br />
The wealth of art is enormous in this country and our eagerness to explore brings you each time, the finest collection of works that connoisseurs of art would treasure!<br />

 As I write this piece, I cannot help but reflecting on some of my analysis done and articles written in 2007/2008, during the formative periods of the Aura Art strategy – on the need for diversification into alternative assets and the strategy to be adopted for participating in Indian Art as an asset class.  Incidentally, the Aura Art launch show which opened on January 29, 2008 missed the stock market peak by a couple of weeks.  At that time, working with Ernst & Young, I was assisting several realty developers to raise Private Equity funding / plan strategy for IPOs at fancy valuations, which all seemed just around the corner.  And then the tide turned…..<br /><br />
      
 The reason I am reflecting again on the ensuing period is that there has hardly been any other period in my investing career of more than 20 years, where asset allocation has appeared more relevant and the knowledge I acquired while obtaining my US CFA Charter (2000-2003) was put to better test.  Never before has the divergence in asset values been so sharp and the benefit of diversification across asset classes more apparent. I would like to illustrate my point of view with the following comparatives…
 <br /><br />
      Between January 2008 and June 2013:
       <ol>
    <li>
      The BSE Sensex has fallen by approximately 10%, from 21,000 to 19,000.  It has 	tested a low of 7,700 in October 2008 (down 63%) and has barely gone above the 	21,000 level in the intervening period.</li>
      <li>Some of the leading Realty stocks, which were the darlings of the street at that 		time, have fallen between 80-95%, with no possibility of appreciation in the intervening period.</li>
      <li>Price of Gold has increased by 200%, from apprx Rs 10,000 per 10 gm to 
      Rs 30,000 per 10 gm – besides, it touched a high of Rs 33,000 per 10 gms in November 2012.</li></ol>
      From the above, one can notice that the returns on a portfolio which has different weightages of the above asset classes would have been very different.  For instance, a non-diversified portfolio of Rs 100 which was invested in Index Fund would have been  Rs 90  (after  touching  a lot  of  close  to  Rs 33  within 9  months  of  investing),  whereas the same Rs 100 invested in only Realty stocks would have been reduced to Rs 10, and if invested entirely in gold would have become Rs 300 – you can see the stark contrast of the different positions.  Hence, the need to maintain a balanced portfolio, with adequate diversification across asset classes.<br />
<br />

Having recognized the need for allocating wealth across asset classes, one needs 	to evaluate what are the other asset classes that offer diversification benefit.  Global studies reveal that art is one such alternate asset class, which has withstood the test of time.  Some of the wealthiest families in the world, foreign corporations, banks and heads of private equity funds have allocated a significant part of their wealth into art, over long periods of time, with encouraging results, inspiring even some pension funds in Britain to follow suit.  The Rothschild family started building its art collection in 1850 and has been investing actively ever since. Baron Eric de Rothschild, Chairman, Rothschild Private Banking & Trust recommends keeping 1/3rd of your assets in equities, 1/3rd in real estate and 1/3rd in art.  This trend is likely to catch up even faster in the Indian context, with the wealth creation cycle only gaining momentum and an ever increasing interest for "investments of passion".  In this, we can yet again draw inspiration from our neighbour, hitherto known for its manufacturing prowess, which is also now emerging as the world leader in this creative field as well.  China has recently overtaken the US as the world's biggest market for art and antiques ending decades of American domination.  China's share of the global art market rose from 23% in 2010 to 30% last year, pushing the United States, with 29%, into second place.  India still lags behind at less than 1% of the global art market.
<br />
<br />
To take into perspective some relative values, even after the top end Indian artists have grown in value by 30-50 times over the last decade, the highest priced Indian painting (apprx USD 3 million or Rs 16 crore for a Raza) is around 1% of the value of the highest priced International painting (USD 250 million or Rs 1,375 crore for 'The Card Players' by Paul Cézanne).  The entire Indian art market is estimated to be around USD 250 million or Rs 1,400 crore – just about the value of one painting by an international artist and less than 1% of the USD 66 billion global art market.  This despite the fact that Indian realty values compare favorably with some of the most prominent destinations in the world and the market capitalization of BSE being in excess of 10% of the market capitalization of NYSE.<br />
<br />

The case for wealth creation through Indian art is stronger than ever before.  Yet, there are divergent trends within the larger art industry which need to be recognized.  Again reflecting on the backdrop of 2007/2008, when the strategy of Aura Art was being formulated.  The period 2000-2007 saw the prices of visible Masters and select contemporary artists who were well promoted moving up by 30-50 times.  However, a large part of the art market was not represented in this move.  This resulted  in  an  anomaly  of  sorts,  since  many of the artists who were of exceptional caliber were priced at a pittance, relative to the prices of the visible Masters.  Aura Art viewed this arbitrage as a hedging opportunity (to migrate capital from visible Masters to the under promoted artists of caliber), more so given the rapid rise in the prices of the Masters, which was not supported by a commensurate increase in number of new collectors who would take fancy to the Masters at the prevailing prices.  The rest is history, given the rather unexpected and unfortunate turn of developments triggered by the global credit crisis, which tested the very foundation of the Indian Art Industry.  The woes of the Art Market were further compounded by the art funds which had raised and invested money in the visible Masters, further increasing the buoyancy in the prices during 2006-2008, but now were faced with a lack luster economic environment and illiquid art market, when the funds were to be redeemed.  A lot of this pain is behind us now and the art market has consolidated itself well, over the last 5 years and is now eagerly awaiting the new leadership to emerge, in terms of industry players and artists.  <br />
<br />

Besides collection, there is also an increasing trend towards consuming more and better art, with home buyers, corporate, hotels and also hospitals becoming more conscious of the need to display quality art to liven the decor, besides making a statement.  The burgeoning growth of the luxury segment in India is another proxy to the growth of the art market.  This again is giving a significant boost to the promising artists, who despite the potential to developing rapidly in times to come, are more affordable now, as compared to the Masters.<br />
<br />

To conclude, judicious application of the principles of wealth management clearly spells out the need to diversify into alternate assets, including art.  The wealth creation momentum as well as the interest in art is only going to pick up in the coming years.  The relatively low values of Indian Art, as compared to global values and the recent run up in values of Chinese art adds to the compelling case.  The consolidation in the Indian Art Market over the last 5-6 years has made many of the Masters, especially those who did not witness significant promotion in the past, very attractively valued.  Besides, there is always an interesting opportunity to collect quality works of promising artists, who are developing on the lines of the Masters.  Focussed promotion of these artists, where quality and potential is established beyond doubt, will only result in significant price discovery, as the market is eager to latch onto new leaders.  <br /><br />

<br />

The question of origins of modernism in Indian art has been a contentious issue amongst the art historians for a long time. While a few art historians say that Raja Ravi Varma brought modernism to Indian art, another set of historians says that it was with Amrita Sher Gill modernism came to the Indian art scene. The latter group believes so mainly by citing the direct western education that Sher Gill had got from Paris. They argue that any artistic experiments that had happened before Sher Gill should be seen as pre-modern experiments that attempted to find a language of modernism in art. Interestingly, towards the end of 19th century, with the western art education firmly in place in the art schools established by the British in India, an aspiration for western academicism was strong amongst the Indian art students of that time. But severing the ties with the traditional Indian art was not that easy and the result was a mixed style created by the Indian artists which had both the traditional Indian elements and the western academic elements in it. This particular style was popularly known as 'Company School Paintings'.  Raja Ravi Varma differed from Company School style as he wanted to emulate the Western Naturalism by the skilful use of oil painting techniques which he was said to have acquired by looking at a visiting western artist namely Theodore Jenson working in the Travancore court.<br />
<br />

If western academicism is the parameter for judging modernism, Ravi Varma had earned the right to call himself a modernist by the early 20th century itself. However, today we appreciate the modernism of Ravi Varma not for his academic skills but for the kind of thematic introductions that he had facilitated in his canvases and  through  his oleographs. Ravi Varma became popular not only amongst the royal patrons but also amongst the common folks mainly because of his choices of subjects for his paintings. Inspired by classical Indian literature and the popular Parsi theatre, Ravi Varma fashioned his themes and characters as embedded in a nascent form within the popular imaginations. By giving these characters a palpable human form Ravi Varma became the first artist who gave clear hagiographic features and human forms to the gods and goddess who had been seen till then as exaggerated stereotypes. The common people of India of that time identified with the Hindu gods and goddesses for the first time through the paintings and oleographs of Ravi Varma. He revelled in the using of oil painting and he found out the possibility of proliferating his works amongst the common people through the oleograph prints mechanically (re)produced in his studios equipped with the imported printing technology.<br />
<br />

Though Ravi Varma popularised art via his oleographs and also gave an elevated status to the artists in society by achieving many commissions from Royal courts and winning prizes from international art exhibitions, the early 20th century nationalists who gravitated around the Tagores in Santiniketan did not like the style of Ravi Varma. They considered Ravi Varma's aesthetics as something retrogressive as it did not politically articulate the nationalistic aspirations of the time. In retrospection though we find that Ravi Varma had contributed towards imagining a unified India through the paintings like 'Galaxy of Musicians' and also had registered the changes occurring in the patriarchic society, historians for a long time kept Ravi Varma out of the discourses on modernism in Indian art because they thought he was a Hindu painter giving physiological specifications to the Hindu gods and goddesses apart from painting royal portraits and royal themes. The trinity who formed the Bengal School of Art, the three Tagores (Abanindranath, Gaganendranath and Rabindranath) were also inclined to find a modern language to oppose the British Colonialism. In order to oppose the occidental, they went to the oriental aesthetics to draw inspiration and themes. They revived the miniature traditions of India, wash technique of Chinese and Japanese art and rearticulated metaphorical themes that subtly critiqued the authoritarian colonial rule. Though later historians called them Revivalists, their kind of revivalism was not about the nostalgic feelings they had for a golden past but they had brought it back with a clear political purpose. The political positioning of the Bengal School artists was so strong that in Santiniketan they refused to use even oil color as it was a British import.<br />
<br />

The arrival of Amrita Sher Gill in the Indian art scene during mid 1930s is considered to be the real arrival of modernism in Indian art scene. Sher Gill was educated in Paris and when she arrived in India, Ravi Varma's influence was on the wane and the Bengal School had already taken over the intellectual aesthetic imagination of the pre-Independence India. Sher Gill found the Bengal School a bit limiting. She traveled all over India and in the true western style she painted the lives of people of India in condensed narratives. Though she had a short artistic career and passed away at the age of twenty eight, within  that  short  span  of  time  she created a body of works that was secular in nature.  Her visual language was radically different from those developed both by Ravi Varma and the Bengal School artists however she was not as politically inclined as the way the Bengal School artists were. If at all we need to discern a sort of political nature in her works, it should be seen in her depiction of the common people (unlike Ravi Varma and unlike the romantic indulgence of the Bengal School artists) and her bold portrayal of Indian women.<br />
<br />

By 1940s, India was going through the height of political struggle for independence and the debates of modern socio-economic and political philosophies were happening everywhere. The artists who belonged to this period could not have excluded themselves from these debates. Artists like Francis Newton Souza, MF Husain, VS Gaitonde, SH Raza, Sadanand Bakre, Gade and KH Ara who had been independently working in Bombay decided to come together to form the Progressive Artists Group, which later came to be known as the Bombay Progressive Group or simply Bombay Progressives. The word 'progressive' stood as a critical pointer that not only connoted the need for questioning the existing political ideologies but also the need for bringing people together through aesthetic means. The Bombay Progressives, though it was a short lived movement, could give a distinct aesthetical identity to Indian art which was modern, international and yet Indian in nature. Such progressive movements also came into being in places like Calcutta, Delhi and Madras with subtle variations in philosophy and style.<br />
<br />

The Progressive Artists Group in Bombay should be seen as a demarcating line between the pre-independent modernism and post-independent modernism of Indian art. Those artists who came after the Progressives in the scene either affiliated with them stylistically or philosophically or departed from these with some sort of vehemence. While Souza went on with his feverish expressionistic language even after shifting from India, artists like Husain decided to stay back and develop a style that had the elements of Indian as well as western modernism. Raza and Gaitonde took to a different trajectory, which was extremely personal and they found their creative satisfaction through painting abstract works. While Gaitonde developed a universal abstract style, Raza's experiments were more on finding the affiliations of abstractions with his experienced Indian past. There was a strong sense of Indian-ness in Raza's works.<br />
<br />

Two streams of aesthetical thoughts developed during 1960-70s and 1980s; their common agenda was to find an indigenous language for Indian art. As a part of international abstract movement, Indian artists of 1960s and 70s also found that it was conducive to search for Indian identity via abstraction. Both in South and North of India such experiments took place under the leadership of artists like KCS Panicker and J Swaminathan respectively. However, in the 1980s, this identity politics took a different turn and the artists who congregated in and around Baroda School initiated a narrative school of painting which art, historically speaking, was a similar experiment like the Tagores of the early 20th century, but now with less severit and with  much  openness  towards  the  other influences.  The  Radical Painters   and Sculptors Association (Radical Group) formed by the mid 1980s created a different sense of political identity for the Indian artists though they invested their energies in finding local themes and expressing them in a provincial expressionistic language. In the 1990s, we see a set of new artists coming to the scene with an international outlook and methods of practice and till date it continues.<br />
<br />

Though there have been appreciations for the Progressives, Abstract artists and the Narratives, there are so many other artists who are yet to be made into a part of the history and appreciated aesthetically and economically. Krishen Khanna was not a part of the Progressive Group officially though he was a fellow traveler. During 1950s and 60s Khanna too had experimented with his language and his thematic interests were mainly centered around the lives of the working class people in and around the urban places like Delhi and Bombay. He simultaneously worked on the lives of the working class like Band Players and the lives of aesthetically elevated people like musicians. He ardently sketched and painted their lives and today we could see his works at par with the works of the Progressives. Satish Gujral, who studied in Mexico carried back a different idea about the working class back home and inspired by the socialist movements went on developing an aesthetic that facilitated articulating the lives and cultures of the people of India. As they move ahead in their creative lives we could see both these artists delving deep into the philosophical aspects pertaining to the lives of the common people; from sanguine expressionism they move towards more and more lyrical expressionism in due course of time, in an effort to grasp the essence of life and individual searches. This happens in the works of Manjit Bawa also, who had started off as the chronicler of local places. Then Bawa went to on to develop a very romantic and lyrical style where the contours of the images became fluid and floating in the space. The distinct style of these artists make them modern masters of Indian art and would definitely be critically evaluated in terms of modern art history and brought to the auction circuits for reassessing and enhancing their prices.<br />
<br />

When we come closer to the recent history of Indian art, there are several artists who have all the potential to become the masters of our times. A JJ School of Art graduate in painting, Yousuf Ali started his career towards the end of 1960s and worked throughout 1970s and 80s till he died a premature death. His works show the verve of the artistic search for an indigenous identity. He eclectically chose subjects from all over India and worked diligently in a very personalized expressionistic language. Though a phase in his works showed that he was going hand in hand with the already established masters like MF Husain, Yousuf Ali could clear a different path for himself. Even Husain had appreciated Ali's works in very flowery terms. Ali's works are collected by many major collectors for pure passion and enthusiasm. However, it is the duty of our art scene to bring him back for reassessment both in aesthetical and economic terms.<br />
<br />

Looking at the works of the veteran artists like Umesh Varma, Paramjit Singh and Prem Singh one gets the feeling that these artists have been around for a long time  and have the potential to be seen as modern masters. Delhi based Umesh Varma has been a witness to the development of modern art in India while working side by side with the modern masters. He developed his distinct style through which he deconstructed the pictorial plane in a cubistic manner and expressed the angst of the modern man in strong metaphorical terms. Both Paramjit Singh and Prem Singh work on landscapes and their depictions verge into the zone of abstraction. These two artists and their styles are a rarity in our art scene as most of the landscape artists tend to depict the places that they see or experience. Here these two artists work on a mental scape, which is pure and romantic at the same time and they create an aesthetic harmony with their works. These two artists also have to be presented for further assessment.<br />
<br />

Sidharth, Yusuf and Wasim Kapoor represent the qualities of three geographical zones that became definitive in marking modernism in Indian art. These three artists entered in their professional careers in the 1980s. Sidharth's work is spiritual and meditative in essence. There is a blend of multifarious aesthetics including Buddhist, Sikh, Sufi and Christian traditions in his work. Yusuf and Wasim from the other end of the spectrum engaged with/through art taking the language of abstraction and stark figuration respectively. Yusuf captured the essence of human life and philosophies in his abstracts and Wasim did the same by portraying the lives of intimate and the immediate. The figurative naturalism of Wasim though stands diametrically opposite to the mild expressionism of Sidharth and the harmonious abstraction of Yusuf, expresses the same essence of life as done by the other two artists of his time. Most importantly these three artists walked (and still walk) along a distinct path since the 1980s even when India was seeing the birth of Narrative Movement and Installation Art movement in the following years. Their works have been in most of the major collection and when an art historical and critical re-assessment is done these artists are going to be very important as locations of creative distinctions within the dominant aesthetical productions of visual art.<br />
<br />

There was a time when Dhurva Mistry was considered to be the most acclaimed international sculptor from India. At a very young age itself he got exposed to the western world and did some path breaking sculptures in Britain and elsewhere. Dhruva Mistry experimented with his sculptural ideas and throughout the 1980s and 1990s brought forth several innovative sculptures in the Indian art scene. In recent times, Dhruva invests his energies in making very contemporary sculptural installations. It is high time that Dhruva's works are to be brought into the scene once again for value judgment. Veteran sculptor Nagji Patel has been instrumental in developing a genre of abstract sculptures in Indian modern and contemporary art scene. He has been working in his favorite mediums of granite and marble. His scales vary from the large scale public sculptures to the gallery based pedestal sculptures. His small scale works both in granite and marble are exquisite pieces of sensitivity and beauty. He generally deals with organic forms and human relationships in erotically charged forms. Tejinder Kanda belongs to a generation that saw the total economic as well as social changes of the Indian society as a part of the globalization. To say more adequately, he belongs to a cusp generation that saw a protected economy and later the opening up of the windows for global flow of economy into the country. As a keen observer of the social changes, he saw how certain work skills were getting obliterated and how displacement of people was taking place in a large scale. A closer look at the thematic that he prefers to paint shows his deep interest in chronicling the social changes through the depiction of people who have been rendered anachronistic by such changes. And to create the effect, he has developed a painting style, which fringes upon strong expressionism, by employing knife and spatula as his tools. The impasto application of paints in fact creates colour fields on his canvases that in their totality bring out the desired images. They have a special kind of animated nature and he establishes a counterpoint to the soft nature of watercolours, a medium often used by artists to depict similar scenes as Tejinder does. <br />
<br />

The 2000s have brought an entirely different reality to our art scene. Thanks to the changed dynamics of the art market, contemporary art flourished for almost ten years. Though it continues to do so, contemporary art has been placed before critical eyes for a different sort of value judgment.  Many experiments with mediums and themes, technologies and approaches have been happening during the last few years. However, there are a few artists who have adopted a contemporary language of aesthetics and yet more concerned with the real human issues than the glossy surfaces that the contemporary aesthetics could produce. Artists like Ganesh Gohain, Shailesh Patel and Ravindra Babu Veguri have been doing very meaningful works for the last one decade. Ganesh Gohain has existential philosophical takes on human life and forms but his approach towards his sculptures and paintings is serenely minimal. They exude a meditative energy around them.<br />
<br />

Ravindra Babu Veguri is one of the young contemporary artists in India who has been working with the themes of development and displacement. Veguri has been watching how development which is also translated as progress making inroads into the lives of the rural people. Their environments change as well as their life-styles. They participate in the progress with joy as well as remorse; they resist as well as embrace development. But they are hopeful that their lands will not be vandalized. Veguri's concern is the concern of these people who have been displaced constantly from their living environs. Though he is critical of mindless development, he also acknowledges the fact that development brings positive changes into the lives of the rural people. This ethical dilemma is caught well in the works of Veguri. His protagonists are hopeful about a bright future and he expresses this hope through the depiction of children. His environmental concerns repeatedly come out in his installations and he is one of the artists who will be assessed by the future markets.<br />
<br />

The Aura Art Show is intended to bring an array of artists who have been working in our art scene for the last few decades. These artists have been collected by major collectors and buyers. A few new artists are being introduced. The Aura Art Show feels that there could be histories rather than having a monopolistic history of Indian modern and contemporary art. Through this Show, such parallel histories could be created. At the same time, when one cuts away from the mainstream history and generates parallel histories, each stream would get its due and finally would contribute to the generation of a larger market for the aesthetical products. All these artists are carefully selected by the Aura Art Group and it has been promoting and carefully placing these artists in the right kind of collections. In the coming years, the artists showcased in this exhibition could make a difference in our contemporary art market. Besides, the need for bringing the excluded artists into the art historical discourses is fulfilled by this art show.<br />
