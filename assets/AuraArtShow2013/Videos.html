Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin a formal, heartwarming inaugural function of Aura Art Show 2013.  <br />
<br />
I must say this entire hall has been transformed into one big master piece of art.  By way of the several paintings here, beautiful paintings, by way of beautiful sculptures, and also by way of the beautiful people who have gathered here today.  I must also say that this venue has been transformed into a spiritually charged one.  If you may read the Chairman's article in the Catalogue 2013, you are bound to come across these beautiful words.  He says "art is the derivative of the finer instincts of man, art is the work of the Supreme Master".  But to elaborate more on that and to give more credibility to that statement, I invite Mr Daljit Singh Sethi, Chairman, Aura Art to make the inaugural address.</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOBnUrkTRl0" target="_blank"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/AuraArtShow2013/images/v2.jpg" width="200" border="0"><br /><strong><center>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOBnUrkTRl0</center></strong></a><br /><a href="Videos.html"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/auraartemails/AuraArtShow2013/images/top.gif" align="right"></a>

Honourable Guests of Honour, our respected Advisors and Patrons, Johnny ML, curatorial consultant of the Show, dignitaries and art lovers gathered here today.  <br />
<br />
My tryst with art began more than two decades ago, when life granted me with the friendship of a great master painter, late S Yousuf Ali.  On the many quiet occasions I interacted with him, it was evident that art "happened" as it were, in an elevated plane of mind when the artist connected with the Supreme Master.  I realised 'art can never be a conscious attempt at creation, but it is the result of consciousness losing its way in the sublime labyrinth of a spiritual plane'.  What dictates the hand of the artist is a voice that you cannot hear, what moves the brush or strikes the chisel, is a force that cannot be measured!<br />
<br />
I firmly believe, love and sensitivity to art can transport us to that elevated plane, impact our lives with the kind of "softness" that can make us better human beings and unite mankind.  Today, this hall is a testimony to that as the most respected consul general's of various countries and the best of the best from all walks of life are gathered here to support this noble endeavor.  Aura Art stands committed to bringing good art close to as wide an audience as possible.  There are many art lovers here who, I am sure, are aspiring to be art collectors, at preferred time to dictate their decision.  Art is all about the heart.  I would say, if your heart dictates today to make the first step, you are on your way to exponential joy that the art collector experiences in time.  I narrate that experience is the morning when we were already putting up the show, one of my friends Deepak and Premal Mehta just walked in and said "I want to be the first to pick up any work" so he bought a set of four paintings.  Similarly, some other friends came, they also marked their choices and booked the paintings.<br />
<br />
The young and dynamic duo of Harmeet and Rishiraj, my sons, have worked relentlessly and intelligently to transform my vision for Aura Art into reality under the guidance of our illustrious advisors and patrons. The contribution of Johnny ML and our communications head, Satish Pillai, whom you heard just before me, have been noteworthy.  I cannot conclude this talk without recalling what the great master of international fame, Pablo Picasso said -- "The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life, off our souls."  It is with great humility that I welcome you all to this soul-cleansing experience of Aura Art Show 2013!

Respected dignitaries, Mumbai's art loving friends.  <br />
<br />
After such an array of works of art, at the presence of bureaucrats, the initiators of an art venue, film director and so many artists, art lovers,  art collectors, art buyers I don't think my words will carry much weight, but still, as the Curatorial Consultant of this project, I would like to says few words.  A few years back, when India Art Summit, United Art Fair, all these things were happening in Delhi most of the people started saying that the art scene has shifted from Mumbai to Delhi.  Now when I see this huge turnout, a large number of artists, art lovers and art collectors here, my belief has changed, along with many other people, that once again Mumbai has proved that Mumbai remains the art hub of India.  Maybe Aura Art Show 2013  is going to the be first to make it big and I am told Mr Daljit Singh Sethi, Rishiraj, Harmeet and the team of advisors are going to make it really really big. I won't take much of your time but still I would like to say that this is one platform, The Aura Art Show is one platform, where you are able to see the works of modern masters, young contemporaries and emerging talent.  Many people still find, because of the boom years experience as well as the recession years experience, they have not much confidence in investing in art, but this kind of effort - well planned, meticulously planned out shows by Aura Art Development, I'm sure that the confidence will again be rebuilt and one visionary and two hardworking young friends they have made all the difference in Aura Art exhibition and I welcome you all to enjoy the show.

What a crowd!  Amazing!  <br />
<br />
You don't usually get a crowd like this for an art show.  But I think that is Aura Art for you.  They have created an "aura" which affects everybody.  I see friends here whom I normally don't see at art shows, but they are here, they are smiling, they are  beaming and good art does that to you.  Good art is not just decorative, good art can be pleasing, good art can be soothing.  Good art can be a catalyst to a higher plan - and that's what I really think Aura Art is.  It can elevate you.  I have surrounded myself with art right from a young age, when I was a student in London I used to buy posters which is all I could afford.  They were on my walls.  Now I have graduated to owning real paintings and the joy they give me, the joy they give visitors to my home is something that makes you very happy and I suggest all of you here who are not collecting collect art, start.  Start modestly, and build it up, you will never regret it.  <br />
Thank you.
