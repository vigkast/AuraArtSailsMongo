  India after Independence was like a dream world. After 200 years of atrocious slavery in British rule, freedom for India was obviously like a dream. Film fraternity rightfully captured this spirit and gave us some of the ‘masterpiece’ movies. It is now two decade past and we call that ‘A Golden Era’ in the world of cinema. That was an era which saw Nehru and Shastri’s dreams coming true. But the dreamy India was not aware, that in addition to this, the cavity was being created in the society. Chaos, corruption, distrust, greed and tyranny had slowly but significantly established themselves in urban as well as rural areas. This was the time when movie ‘Zanjeer’ was released, based on theme of fighting for the rights of common man and aggression against injustice. Films were also made which challenged incompetent nature of a person, explored love and applauded the sensitive emotional ties between people. Some of the interesting movies in these lines were: Saat Hindustani, Pukaar, Inqualab, Kala Patthar, Don, Sholay, Deewar, Abhimaan, Silsila, Yarana, Jadugar, Anand etc. As a result of Globalization, today the whole world has apparently acquired the ‘Corporate’ form. <br />
By the year 1995 globalization had also made a deep impact on business sector of India and there were reasonable changes in its policies and rules of conduct. We witness transformation of ‘entertaining and dramatic’ Amitabh Bacchan into a very corporate anchor in ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’ (KBC). From portraying an arrogant but dignified person, who says, “ mai phainke hue paise nahi uthata.”, to being ethical by using respectable addresses and words like Namaste or Vaddakkam, we see this ‘Vijay’ issuing the cheques with complete affinity to the winners of KBC.</p>

Dincharya – Depicting the kaleidoscopic effects of a big city on mortality. Life in a metro is a privileged at the same time overexposed. We are so enmeshed in this crippled system that we fail to be responsible and respectful towards mortality. This piece is symbolic of all the pothole spotting, smoke hogging, crazy honking, pill popping and doctor hopping that goes on in big cities. It is a vicious circle - elements cause ailments, then we get multiple treatments, then the relapse and finally the body gives up after over abuse.
Mortality has now become the new commodity to measure status-quo.</font></p>

<strong>Thoughts of Artist<br /></strong>Tribute: “Saluting the memories of the recent loss to the music industry in 2011-2012.”<br />
It is a contemporary shrine to pay respect and learn about the musical legends. It is a symbol of their work (as a singer, songwriter, composer, etc.) still being present among us even after they have passed.  
The walk through the shrine will make one nostalgic as one moves down the memory lane - because it is a personal experience of memory flashbacks there is no predestined walkway.<br />
Look up! The microphone chandelier should remind you of the recording studios where music was birthed and the lights have a, multifaceted significance. - They are symbolic of the shinning stars themselves; the concerts and stages they performed on and most of all as a tribute to their glorious work.<br />NB: Please note that the two famous personalities that you will see in this memory maze have left behind their own era. Yash Chopra, for giving us the most romantic melodies and Steve Jobs for iTunes and iPods

Installation represents immense latent power that women possess. She is the cradle of birth and source from which environment draws energy for sustenance of life on earth.
She is the manifestation of mother earth. Switches don't light up and wires don't ignite but draw controlled power to the  appliance that plug into it. So typical of women who's a giver as a mother, a wife, a sister, a daughter, a friend.
The wires around her represent of her dexterity to reach out to anyone,  her femininity, her flexibility to adjust to any surrounding.
So less of her is acknowledged.
This installation is a tribute to the power of women.

Her latest installation displayed here is an introspective piece, reflecting all those who view it and the world around it. A natural form expressed in the urban contemporary mediums of metal, glass and plastic, the piece is inspired by the beautiful myth of 'A thunderstorm starts with the beat of a Butterfly's wing'  and named 'Pollination of Glass and Metal'.

The green forest covers are fast depleting, the human natives of these natural habitats are being displaced, wildlife is in grave danger, a whole life style with all flora and fauna scream for attention and due concern from mankind. Or else the forbidden might happen when we have to replicate and fake our very nature, our ecosystem. Climate change and global warming is a reality, counter it now.
<br />
Start that with making our future generation more aware and sensitive, making them more concerned whatever we have lost in the pursuit of development. Be near to nature, you need to see and conserve real forests or else be doomed to see fake samples maybe just picture of so much of our flora and fauna. Do your fair bit,  develop a green area, as much as you can afford from a pot to a plot.Visit as many forests; national parks, bird sanctuaries as you can,  take children along, let them see Mother Nature and feel the wind, mud, water and soil. Furthermore, cultivate awareness and habits in future generation for sustainable living and environmental concerns.
<br />
Think and know more about climate and its changes and come up with more ways to conserve.Take active part in any kind of activism for environmental concerns. This much is needed by all aware individuals, again it's on you how much you can. From weekend voluntary service in your local area to any kind of contribution by maybe even planting a tree in your vicinity, or even joining an organization full time. The point is to get involved. 
<br />
It's on each individual to take a stand and do our bit. Owe it to yourself /owe it to your future generation/ owe it to our mother earth. Do your bit and conserve.
