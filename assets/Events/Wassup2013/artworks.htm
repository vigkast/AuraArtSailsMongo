Arzan Khambatta calls himself an architect by profession and a sculptor by choice.  Encouraged by his parents, he started sculpting the very next day after giving his 10th standard exams. He would scout the streets, garages, construction sites for scrap metal, collect the same and weld them into pieces of art he fondly christened “SCRAPTURES”.  A word that has become synonymous with Arzan.  His works have been displayed in 10 solo shows and over 50 group shows around the country and the globe. </font></p></td>

<br /><br /><strong>Thoughts of Artist</strong><br />This Installation depicts the continuous degeneration of morals and increasing corruption in our society, with everything and everyone being on sale - you need a right buyer to buy you out.  The young student passing out from collage also thinks what his price would be in the real world.  Separately, there is a retail revolution unraveling in India, with all the retail chains (Walmart, Ikea etc) wanting a foothold in the Indian market.

<u>Sangeeta Singh:</u> Born in 1968, studied science before changing her course to pursue her passion for painting and trained at the Triveni Kala Sangam as a protégé of eminent artist Rameshwar Broota. She also studied art at the National Museum and in Mizoram. Through perseverance, hard work and devotion, the artist continues to experiment and innovate and bring freshness to her creations .The varied exposure gets reflected in her surreal work interwoven with beauty in a distinct palette and compositions.<br />

<u>Sukant Panigrahy:</u> creates art to engage and inspire community groups to become aware of nature and its beauty, using eco sustainable, recyclable materials.  Originally from Ganjam, Orissa, Sukant is an award winning art director (Filmfare, Star Screen Awards, Asia Pacific Film Festival Best Art Director) with an extensive career including films such as “Dev D” and Owais Hussain’s “Ek Tara”. Sukant also worked with MF Hussain creating sets and art work for “Gaja Gamini”.  As an art director he created many large sets, inspiring him to create similarly large independent works, which unlike film industry sets, use recyclable, ecologically sound materials. His preferred mediums are bamboo and living plants.

<strong>Thoughts of Artist</strong><br />While Foreign Direct Investment ("FDI") is definitely welcome in select sectors where large quantum of Investment is required, the Policy makers need to guard against opening the Gate for FDI too wide open.... else we run the risk that all profitable growth oriented and important industries may be owned by foreign corporations, with deep pockets (for instance the large buy-outs of Indian pharma majors witnessed a couple of years ago).. we should rather encourage greater domestic capital formation and an higher equity / entrepreneurial culture amongst Indians (FIIs own large stakes in most of the blue-chips listed on the Indian Stock Exchanges, and the retail participation)...

<strong>Thoughts of Artist</strong><br />
  India after Independence was like a dream world. After 200 years of atrocious slavery in British rule, freedom for India was obviously like a dream. Film fraternity rightfully captured this spirit and gave us some of the ‘masterpiece’ movies. It is now two decade past and we call that ‘A Golden Era’ in the world of cinema. That was an era which saw Nehru and Shastri’s dreams coming true. But the dreamy India was not aware, that in addition to this, the cavity was being created in the society. Chaos, corruption, distrust, greed and tyranny had slowly but significantly established themselves in urban as well as rural areas. This was the time when movie ‘Zanjeer’ was released, based on theme of fighting for the rights of common man and aggression against injustice. Films were also made which challenged incompetent nature of a person, explored love and applauded the sensitive emotional ties between people. Some of the interesting movies in these lines were: Saat Hindustani, Pukaar, Inqualab, Kala Patthar, Don, Sholay, Deewar, Abhimaan, Silsila, Yarana, Jadugar, Anand etc. As a result of Globalization, today the whole world has apparently acquired the ‘Corporate’ form. <br />
By the year 1995 globalization had also made a deep impact on business sector of India and there were reasonable changes in its policies and rules of conduct. We witness transformation of ‘entertaining and dramatic’ Amitabh Bacchan into a very corporate anchor in ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’ (KBC). From portraying an arrogant but dignified person, who says, “ mai phainke hue paise nahi uthata.”, to being ethical by using respectable addresses and words like Namaste or Vaddakkam, we see this ‘Vijay’ issuing the cheques with complete affinity to the winners of KBC.</p></td>

<strong>Thoughts of Artist</strong><br />
Dincharya – Depicting the kaleidoscopic effects of a big city on mortality.<br />
Life in a metro is a privileged at the same time overexposed. We are so enmeshed in this crippled system that we fail to be responsible and respectful towards mortality. <br />
This piece is symbolic of all the pothole spotting, smoke hogging, crazy honking, pill popping and doctor hopping that goes on in big cities. It is a vicious circle - elements cause ailments, then we get multiple treatments, then the relapse and finally the body gives up after over abuse.
Mortality has now become the new commodity to measure status-quo.</font></p></td>

<strong>Thoughts of Artist<br />
</strong>Tribute: “Saluting the memories of the recent loss to the music industry in 2011-2012.”<br />

It is a contemporary shrine to pay respect and learn about the musical legends. It is a symbol of their work (as a singer, songwriter, composer, etc.) still being present among us even after they have passed.  
The walk through the shrine will make one nostalgic as one moves down the memory lane - because it is a personal experience of memory flashbacks there is no predestined walkway.  
Look up! The microphone chandelier should remind you of the recording studios where music was birthed and the lights have a, multifaceted significance. - They are symbolic of the shinning stars themselves; the concerts and stages they performed on and most of all as a tribute to their glorious work.<br />

NB: Please note that the two famous personalities that you will see in this memory maze have left behind their own era. Yash Chopra, for giving us the most romantic melodies and Steve Jobs for iTunes and iPods

<strong>Thoughts of Artist</strong><br />
Installation represents immense latent power that women possess. She is the cradle of birth and source from which environment draws energy for sustenance of life on earth.
She is the manifestation of mother earth.
Switches don't light up and wires don't ignite but draw controlled power to the  appliance that plug into it. So typical of women who's a giver as a mother, a wife, a sister, a daughter, a friend.
The wires around her represent of her dexterity to reach out to anyone,  her femininity, her flexibility to adjust to any surrounding.
So less of her is acknowledged.
This installation is a tribute to the power of women.

Her latest installation displayed here is an introspective piece, reflecting all those who view it and the world around it. A natural form expressed in the urban contemporary mediums of metal, glass and plastic, the piece is inspired by the beautiful myth of 'A thunderstorm starts with the beat of a Butterfly's wing'  and named 'Pollination of Glass and Metal'.

Rohan Sonavane's latest series of bronze sculptures "Buddha in Bronze Repose" capture the serene and blissful quality of the Compassionate One with intricate motifs of the flora & fauna so beloved to the Lord presented in loving detail by the artist in an elongated style that gives his creations added beauty and grace.
