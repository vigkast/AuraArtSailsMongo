The strings spun around the spindle are a medium of spreading our words, emotions/feelings, dreams, happiness … to the world. Along with the soaring kites the pattern of the strings on the spindle also soar into the sky as if merging its fragrance with the Universe. And when we wind the string back onto the spindle then it is just the string and no pattern but just an image of the pattern, which never can be retrieved no matter how much we desire. The form pattern changes to a formless imagery.  The strings pattern on the spindle influences the thought and lifestyles of people whose fragrance is widespread in our culture and society.  I want to share this experience of mine.
Creating works of Art out of “Charkhi” or spindles, combining painting with sculpture, has been a very unique, fulfilling and interesting experience for me.

<h1>Thoughts of the Artist</h1><p><div align="left">She is the cradle<br>
The very source of energy<br>
She is a Women<br>
a mother, a wife, a friend, a stranger<br>
an enigma<br>
She brings along that exquisite energy every time she comes by<br>
because that is what she does<br>
She reaches out<br>
Because she only knows how<br>
And she leaves behind her femininity<br>
her power of positivity<br>
If you decide to follow her path<br>
you will feel it too<br>
That feeling of euphoria<br>
that trails her<br>
and multiplies<br>
with every passing reflection and lingering shadow<br>
Almost because she commanded the walls to make you feel so<br>
It is these Vibes of a Woman<br>
that make or break an immaculately designed space<br>
Because the only things that ever do stay behind<br>
Are reflections<br>
and The Vibes of that Woman<br>
