		<h1>In Conversation – Vrundavan Solanki with Chaitya Dhanvi Shah<br>
&copy; Copyright – Marvel Art Gallery Pvt Ltd, Ahmedabad
</h1>
            <p align="justify"> <span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> Having a conversation with you has always been pleasure but this time it will be accompanied with excitement since it is all about your 41st solo show. <br>
How does it feel to you as an artist after doing so many solo shows in the journey from your first show in 1963 at Jehangir Art Gallery to the present show at Marvel Art Gallery in 2010?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> It feels great. It always feels good to me when I am exhibiting my work in solo or group show, nationally or internationally. But I don’t find any difference when I compare my various shows because every show has a unique importance to me. I have never had any pressure to hold a show. Exhibiting my work gives me more and more confidence and energy. The distinct feeling between my first show and the present show is that I am gradually moving closer in depicting what I want to paint. I personally believe that I still have a long way to go which keeps me driving. <br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> What elements made you an artist? Because it is quite astonishing for a person born and raised in a small town like Junagadh to pick art as a pursuit of happiness.</span>  <br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> (Smiles for a moment) Even my father thought the same, but I am very thankful to my mother who motivated me and convinced my father that I was a born artist. My artistic nature made me involve in many creative things like poems, drama and paintings. As the time was passing by, my interest was also leaning towards reading various Guajarati novels and magazines among which “Kumar” and “Dharmayug” were my favorites. The paintings and their descriptions in those magazines developed my esthetic sense for art and ultimately leading to make art as my religion.  When I was young, the natural beauty of Junagadh’s forest used to provoke my art feelings every single day along with inspiring me to paint more and more.  <br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> Your student life as a fine arts student at two prominent art colleges namely J.J. School of Arts at Mumbai and MS University at Baroda was full of twist and turns. Can you elaborate more on this? </span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> Yes, I had the privilege to have the best of education in both these institutes with excellent faculties. But as you said my college life was full of twist and turns. I got admission in JJ School of Arts, Mumbai due to my strong fundamentals but later on I was quite uncomfortable with the surroundings. So, I left that college and got my self into MS University, Baroda. But my fate had something else planned out for me. Soon, so many things happened that proved to be the turning point for my career. I took part in the Gujarat State Lalitkala Academy Annual Exhibition and even though I was a student, I exhibited my work in the artist category. I was filled with nervousness initially but later that got replaced with happiness when but I got the first prize in the artist section. That was very surprising and memorable moment, which I cherish even now. On somebody’s suggestion I decided to hold my first solo show at Jehangir art gallery, Mumbai. For giving my best to that show, I discontinued my education at that point of time and fortunately the show was successful. Later, I rejoined MS University to complete my education and received a diploma in painting and post diploma in graphics in 1982.<br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah: </strong>While doing a study on your paintings, right from your early works to present ones, only the rural India is painted but why not the urban Indian figures?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> I was born and raised in rural background. Right from my childhood I have been a keen observer and I love to study people. If we talk about the figures then I am very much attached to my village and that is an integral part of me. There are so many elements to explore from these figures. I find several shapes while they are sitting, standing, various gestures, their costumes and accessories etc. I observe these characters very minutely. Looking at them I feel to paint abstract sooner or later for which I continuously do “riyaaz”. Also, the rural culture is vanishing and people are coming more forward to the urban scene. But they are still “desi” by heart and their roots lies to their village only. I want to preserve this rural scenario to our coming generations through my works. I want the real Indian culture to be explored in a contemporary way. <br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> Why does your palette have only 2 colours namely Black and Sepia?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> I am very choosy and selective about what I work and with what I work. For me subject is vital. I want to give weight to my subject or the content rather then its colours. I don’t like if my colours overshadow my subject and somehow I have this relation with black and white, which comes very naturally to me.<br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> OK. Then what about sepia? I came to know that you started applying it on the insistence of your wife Chitra. </span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> Oh yes, that’s true. Actually Chitra saw my mural at the Air India office at New York. That mural had almost 20 shades of brown.  She got so engrossed in it that she kept on insisting me to use sepia in my work but on the other side I didn’t want to get anxious and I preferred being calm till I get confident about it. But after 7 years of her persistence, I am into using the sepia as a part of my palette.
<br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> Why your figures don’t have any faces?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> I don’t want my figures to get bound around particular faces or expressions. I prefer giving complete liberty to my figures instead of binding them. I want my viewers to view what they perceive rather then me forcing them for it. The ray of light gives me different shapes altogether. I like this spiritual light and therefore you can feel the white space as a light. I want my paintings to be spiritual and peaceful. 
<br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> How do you study these various expressions and portray them in your creations?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> As I told you, I am a very keen observer of my surroundings. I observe every person I meet or see around me. Right now I am observing your various expressions while you asking me questions. Who knows I might end up using it in another painting of mine. Also, I keep thinking and imaging a lot. I imagine practically and then I figure it out in my own way.<br><br>

<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> Your works are not restricted to a particular range of size. It varies completely from huge canvases to smaller paper works. How do you balance the work with changing sizes?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> I think that if a person is truly involved in his work, size does not matter.  It’s always the quality that matters whether it’s a 5 x 5 ft or 5 x 5 inch work. You must be transparent to yourself while working on it. I take it as a challenge that how shall I use the space and extract maximum out of it. <br><br>


<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> I assume it will be the same case with the use of different mediums?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> Exactly. I find it very exciting since altogether it has been a learning experience for me. It helps me to improve as an artist, be it any medium like, Linocut, Woodcut, Etchings, Drawings and even Pastels. <br><br>

<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> How much time do you take to complete one painting?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> Well, It depends on the size and my mindset. But on an average it takes eight to ten days in order to conclude the painting entirely. I keep on working on the painting till I am completely satisfied.<br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> I have seen you working for hours at a stretch, which continues for weeks. How do you relax yourself?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> I don’t take stress at all because I enjoy my work thoroughly.  My companion is my television which is always on simultaneously. When I am not working I go to sleep. That’s the best way I get myself relaxed.<br><br>
 
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> I wonder you have work on so many series like the Nudes, Tata series, kite festival, Portraits, Mumbai series and more. Why you haven’t exhibited them yet?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> I have exhibited some of them in my earlier shows. But whatever you work is not meant only for exhibiting. I do certain series because I like doing it and they are completely for my personal satisfaction. Out of them some are for my personal collections. It is also not the case that I will never exhibit them, but just waiting for the time to come which makes me feel that now I shall show various forms of my works and approaches to the art lovers.

<br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> You have widely traveled to mostly all parts of the world, can you share some of your travel experience?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> I personally find every city in the world to be the same. I still don’t know why, but whether I am visiting New York or Mumbai it feels the same to me. I feel familiar everywhere and feel that I have been to that particular place before even though It might be my first trip. I find a common sound between “tabla” played in Jaisalmer and the guitar on the streets of Venice. On my visit to Paris, I went to see Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. I was so thrilled and as I stood in front of it I suddenly started weeping. 
<br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>
Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> Why?   </span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> Don’t know. Even if today someone asks me about Mona Lisa, tears flow out of my eyes. I absorb the subject within me as soon as I like it, whether I paint it or not becomes a different matter. When I saw the residence of Sherlock Holmes, I started feeling that I know him very well and started sketching his residence. I think it happens because of my involvement with what I observe and feel.<br><br>


<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> You have won so many awards and recognitions from various art societies across India and recently the Gujarat Lalitkala Gaurav Purushkar award from the Gujarat government.  You must be a proud man?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> I love awards and get very excited to receive them. But that’s not the only thing for me. With due respect, awards only motivate me to work hard. But my real recognition or honor lies with the art lovers. It gives me eternal satisfaction when people appreciate my creations. On many incidents, I have seen that my works purchased in the 60’s are as much loved by the third generation as their grandparents did. Now that’s the biggest reward for me.<br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> What gives you the energy to organize camps, exhibitions of young artists and other art events?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> It is my way of saying thanks to the society for giving me the respect and honor. I feel that it is my responsibility to give something in return to the art community. When me and my wife conduct such events, I get to learn millions of things from every individual I meet. I get to learn their behavior, body language, their feelings, emotions and sharing of experiences. So, I would say that it is a nice way to learn something new and I get immense energy from that. <br><br>

<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> You said you like poems a lot. You read and write them in your free time. Which poet do you admire?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> Pablo Neruda is my all time favorite.<br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> How about music? Any particular instrument and artist you like to listen?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> I am very fond of Pandit Jasraj, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi and Hariprasad Chaurasia. <br><br>

<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> How about a Painter?</span><br>
<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> I like Pablo Picasso for his enormous works in various mediums and the visualization he had for his works was exceptional. But I admire KG Subramanium, MF Husain and SH Raza for their personality, their energy and the positive vibes that they spread around them. Every time I meet them, I feel the same energy flowing from them which highly motivates me. <br><br>

<strong>Vrundavan Solanki: </strong> Let me ask you this one question, what do you feel after looking at this recent works of mine?<br><br>
<span class="textbg"><strong>Chaitya Dhanvi Shah:</strong> Emotions, emotions and emotions that’s the only word that comes out of my mind. Every painting is a reflection of the basic feelings that a person carries with itself. Feeling of first love, first touch, feeling of committment, feeling of being together, feeling of going away, feeling of a father, feeling of a passionate lover etc. Though the paintings are without faces, it communicates variety of expressions and moods of love. I am emotionally driven towards them, as I can connect to these paintings. I find it as a story where the man goes into flashback and shares his story with the viewers. I think it’s a story which every person goes through once in his lifetime.</span></p>
